Bulle,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/bulle/,46.61955,7.05834,"Situated in the heart of Gruyère, the city of Bulle is the administrative capital of this largely agricultural region and has a wealth of attractions to appeal to all tastes.","In this preserved and unspoilt environment, the visitor can enjoy the most varied and seasonal activities in a pastoral setting.Firmly anchored in ancestral and typical traditions, its museum charts the marked development of the town and its surrounding region. Renowned as a cultural meeting place, the city boasts folk markets, livestock fairs, salons, exhibitions, theatres, concerts and shows which attract a very diverse public audience.The culinary arts remain the focal point for many visitors to Gruyère, and each year the local restaurants offer Bénichon feast menus alongside regional specialities."
Muotathal,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/muota-valley/,46.97367,8.75985,"The Muota Valley is known for its down-to-earth weather prophets and its more than 200-kilometer-long karst Höllloch cave system. But it has plenty more to offer, even in winter, and for anyone who wants to give ice climbing a go, this is the perfect place!","The Muota valley is a green, drawn-out and mountain-encircled Schwyz mountain valley that has its valley entrance close to the cantonal capital and which borders Uri Canton in the south and Glarus Canton in the east. Extending across 172 square kilometres, the Muota valley ranks among Switzerland’s ten largest communes in respect of area, and is nearly as large as the entire canton of Zug.The commune region is home to one of the longest caves in the world. According to the latest research, the labyrinth of Höllloch caves which was discovered in 1875 extends across 195 kilometres (!) and lies under the karst terrain of the primeval forest-like Bödmeren forest and the Silberen. In contrast to other caves, the ‘Höllloch’ (hell-hole) has hardly been tamed for visitors with the likes of concreted pathways or electric lighting. Tours into the Höllloch – ranging from 1½-hour short guided tours through to expeditions of several days with bivouac – are therefore conducted by trained guides. In this underground world the stalagmites and stalactites, but also the deep gorges, enchanting rock formations, ‘glacial mills’ and fossilizations are all spectacular to see.The secluded geographical location has helped the folk in the valley to retain their down-to-earth character and their staid sense of calmness. Also famous far and wide is their dry sense of humour, which forms the theme for an explanatory ‘humour walking trail’. A unique, much-loved style of folk music has also been retained. The Muota valley weathermen, also named “Wetterschmöcker” in Swiss German, are much celebrated. Twice yearly these prophets present annual weather forecasts with much humour; the forecasts are strongly underpinned by outdoor observations.Ski tours can be undertaken until well into May, with the Blüemberg, the Glatten and the Twärenen being the most popular destinations. Easily accessible Schwyz ski areas are Stoos-Fronalpstock-Klingenstock (above the entrance to the Muota valley) und Sattel-Hochstuckli near Rothenturm.Spray-infused waterfalls, rushing white water streams, colour-bedecked wildflower meadows and bizarre karst landforms all belong to the overground natural beauties of the Muota valley. Visitors seeking tranquillity will find an extensive network of rambling trails. At Muotathal village, the valley forks: the Bisistal leads southwards where a cableway ultimately takes visitors up onto the Glattalp (mountain restaurant). In an easterly direction, the Muota valley rises up to the Pragel pass, the link to the Klöntalersee in the canton of Glarus.See the sledge dogs in action during the summer half year. Learn the right way to deal with the huskies and enjoy a trip with your new four-legged friends."

Charmey,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/charmey/,46.61887,7.16586,"Fancy spending some time amid a picture-postcard landscape in the heart of Switzerland? The Fribourg Region, especially the village of Charmey, is a charming place to visit: romantic little towns, fragrant Alpine meadows, steaming thermal baths, enchanting lakes, snowy slopes and ancient customs that survive to this very day. Whatever the time of year, you’re guaranteed to have an experience that will delight all your senses.","It’s hardly surprising that this idyllic area has produced a real superstar: Le Gruyère, the world-famous cheese with PDO status. The flavoursome milk used to produce it comes from cows that graze on the fragrant flora and lush grass of Alpine meadows. Alpine cheese dairies in the region are open to the public and happy to show visitors how the delicious cheese is made. And in summer, you can even enjoy Fribourg speciality fondue moitié-moitié (made with Vacherin and Gruyère) while marvelling at the fantastic views of the Moléson and the Fribourg Pre-Alps from the comfort of the Charmey cable car.The whole area is steeped in agricultural tradition and customs, including wood-shingle roofs, colourful Alpine cattle processions, herb festivals, Poya (paintings depicting the migration of the herds to and from their Alpine pastures) and a romantic farmer’s trail. Speaking of trails, the area is also great for a whole range of outdoor activities thanks to a network of hiking, cross-country skiing and bike trails, not to mention ski slopes. For thrill seekers, there is also paragliding and a zipwire. If you visit the small photogenic town of Gruyères, make sure you have your camera with you. An absolute must for those with a sweet tooth: the Maison Cailler chocolate factory in the little village of Broc.If you’re looking for relaxation and a bit of a pampering, there’s no place better than Les Bains de la Gruyère, where pools are heated to 34 degrees. The pools are particularly beautiful in winter when steam rises from the water and the surrounding mountains glisten with snow.Skiers can take the cable-car up to the Vounetse in the massif of the Dents Vertes. The six lifts, a snowpark, floodlit cross-country tracks, snow-shoe routes and mean there is a wide range of winter sports available. The family-friendly skiing area of Jaun, with its four lifts, also offers all the benefits of a compact skiing area for families with children. There are other nearby skiing areas on the La Berra (1720 m) and Moléson (2002 m).For walkers and lovers of Nordic walking and mountain biking, Charmey is just the right place: there are various tracks marked out, for example on the Vounetse mountain (1627 m) with its fine views, and there are maps showing them too. At the middle station of the cable-car you can test your skills and courage in a rope adventure park with five routes. There are signposted paths with information boards about the alpine economy and the flora and fauna, drawing your attention to the special features of the landscape. Finally, at the top station there is an alpine cheesery where Gruyère AOP cheese is still made in the traditional way over a wood fire.The Jaun Pass connects the Gruyère region with the Simmental in the Bernese Oberland. In summer, the steep, weather-beaten slopes of the Gastlosen (1998m) attract many hikers and climbers to the area. Nearby Jaun, at the foot of an impressive waterfall, is close to the language border between French and German. Here it is worth visiting the old cemetery with its many wooden carvings, recalling the previous occupations of those who are buried there.Let yourself be charmed by the mountains! Charmey offers holidays in a unique setting where nature and tradition are respected and cherished. Discover the many facets of this Prealpine region at any season, all year round.The idyllic landscape around Charmey is formed of ten valleys. Among the rivers, lakes, Alpine meadows and mountain peaks, hikers and mountain-bikers can find a host of signposted trails of varying levels of difficulty. There are plenty of attractions for families, too – including an adventure rope park, mini-golf and the Rapido Sky gondola. Panoramic cabins (each accommodating 8 people) bring you to the summit of Vounetz (1,650m), and glorious views of the Prealps.The traditional world of the Alpine pastures twinned with the magic of the “Bains de la Gruyère” spa: wellbeing and relaxation in their purest form!"

Colourfully-painted oriel windows are a town feature. The Abbey precinct with the cathedral and Abbey Library has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage listing.","St.Gallen’s most famous landmark is its Baroque cathedral with theAbbey Library, which houses some 170,000 documents – in part hand-written and over a thousand years old. The library probably also has Switzerland’s most beautiful Rococo hall. The entire Abbey precinct was declared aUNESCOworld heritage site in 1983.The name and foundation of the town stem from the Irish missionary monk Gallus who founded a hermitage here around 612. From 747, the then St.Gallen monastery was already following Benedictine Rule, which required the contemplative study of books and accordingly also stipulated the presence of a library. In the Middle Ages, the town developed into an important hub of culture and education in Europe. Later, the St.Gallen embroideries attracted international recognition and brought prosperity to the town.St.Gallen is a university town with a focus on the economic sciences. The home town of the renowned «Mummenschanz» theatre group offers a varied cultural offering with theatres and museums. In summer, the romantic art-nouveau Dreilinden-Weiher open-air pool with its splendid views over the town attracts visitors to swim.The excellent location in the four-country corner Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the Principality of Liechtenstein make St.Gallen the best starting point for excursions into the Appenzellerland with the Säntis, and to Lake Constance. Whether by rail or bicycle, the cycling and inline paradise of Lake Constance can be reached quickly along the Lake Constance Cycle Path. The combination of rail ‘n’ bike allows captivating tours to be undertaken which cross national borders. For walkers, the ‘Bridge Trail’ which passes over 18 bridges in the Sittertobel near St.Gallen is an experience: much about the design and construction of bridges is learnt en route. A six-hour section of the ‘Route of St. James’ leads from Rorschach to Herisau via St.Gallen.The Voralpen-Express connects Lake Constance with Lucerne via St.Gallen in 2:45 hours. This 149-km-long transversal travelling across the foothills of the Alps is interesting from a technical rail viewpoint, but also impresses with stunning landscapes such as the Toggenburg, Lake Zurich, and hill moor of Rothenturm.Just an hour from Zurich Airport, close to the borders with Germany and Austria, St.Gallen is a cosmopolitan, outgoing university city. Creative cuisine is combined with excellent seminar hotels. Lake Constance and the charming villages of the Appenzell region are attractive places for excursions."

Zug,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/zug-1/,47.16626,8.5155,"Even the residents of Zug never tire of looking at it: when the sun sets over the lake, the horizon lights up ruby-red and all eyes are drawn to the romantic kaleidoscope of colours on the water. But even this is rivalled by the historic old town, where you can stroll through the labyrinthine narrow streets, saunter along the lakeside, or watch the colourful comings and goings from one of the many pavement cafés. ","Zug is self-confident and knows what it has to offer: a high quality of life, a view of the Rigi and Pilatus, and a jewel of a historic centre. It’s a stylish town that values public art. This goes together with the town’s business world, which lends the pretty town a certain international flavour: well over 100 nations in Zug greet each other with a friendly “Grüezi”.History tells us that the town was founded in the early 13th century by the counts of Kyburg. The 52-metre-highZytturmalso dates back to this period. Initially built as a simple gateway in the old town wall, over the centuries it was expanded and its height increased until it attained the form we see today, with its oriel windows and steep hipped roof. In 1574 the great clock was built into it, giving the tower its present name. Under this main clock there is an astronomical timepiece with four hands indicating the week, the phase of the moon, the month, as well as whether it is currently a leap year.InZug’s old townitself there are fine sights in the form of the late gothictown hallbuilt in 1505 andSt. Oswald’s church, from the same period. You can certainly lose yourself in the picturesque narrow streets of the old town, without actually getting lost: saunter past brightly coloured rows of houses, pretty boutiques and tempting restaurants – and you’ll end up in Landsgemeindeplatz, the main square on the lake.This is where Zug lives, celebrates and simply takes it easy on fine summer evenings. Children love the aviaries, fans of the water can hire boats, and romantics simply appreciate the world’s most beautiful sunset.Zug is certainly not just somewhere to visit in summer. It has plenty to offer during the coldest part of the year too. For example, there’s the Zugerberg, Zug’s local mountain. Eight minutes is all it takes to get out of the town and into the country. A short hike over the snow-covered winter landscape of the Zugerberg is particularly atmospheric. The Zugerberg provides a contrast to the town’s hustle and bustle with stillness, the beauty of nature and an impressive panorama.For the more energetic, the Zugerberg is a place where you can put on your cross-country skis and get going. At 925 metres above sea level and looking over the valley mist: the snowy upland landscape is the ideal terrain for it. You’re rewarded with a view of the Rigi and the Pre-Alps. Zug’s winter wonderland is a world of its own, and an inviting place to go sledging and snowshoeing as well.In Zug itself, winter is also a time for celebration. Old-time customs and traditions live on, such as Bäckermöhli, Zuger Fasnacht, Greth Schell, Chrööpfelimee and Märlisunntig. To find out what lies behind these quirky names, you’ll have to visit the charming town of Zug!In summer the whole town enjoys “la dolce vita” of Lake Zug – by, on, or in the water. A special surprise: all of Zug’s swimming spots are free to use, whether by the casino in the town centre, at the carefully maintained beach, or in the natural surroundings of “Brüggli”. It’s said that nowhere else in Switzerland is the sunset more impressive than at Lake Zug. You’ll have your own private box from which to take in the show if you go to one of the many lakeside restaurants on Lake Zug to enjoy an evening cocktail.If you feel like spending an idyllic summer’s day on the lake, go to one of the town’s three jetties, step onto one of the Lake Zug Navigation Company steamers and let it ferry you through the fairytale scenery. The fresh breeze, the feeling of leaving your everyday life behind and the view of the surrounding shores are as reviving as a day in a spa. But then again, there’s a whole host of sporting activities on offer, by, on and in the water: stand-up paddle boarding, wakeboarding or pedalos – to name but a few.But you shouldn’t miss a stroll through the old town either, which is situated right by the lake. 140 shops and restaurants nestle amid the historic houses of Zug’s old town. Traditional handicrafts meet timeless cultural goods; centuries-old traditions sit side-by-side with modern lifestyles.Finally, a visit to the town of Zug should never be without a delightful taste of Kirschtorte, its famous cherry torte. Lovers of the Zuger Kirschtorte have included such Hollywood greats as Audrey Hepburn and Charlie Chaplin. Zug is proud to be known as the “Cherry Canton”. Numerous cherry-related customs and traditions are celebrated in the town and indeed in the whole region. Cherry walks are particularly popular, for example.And then there are social festivals and sumptuous events that are held from spring until late summer. Starting with the cherry blossom, moving on to the Zug Lake Festival and right through to Jazz Night."

Here you’ll find the first cable-car in the world to have revolving panoramic gondolas to take passengers up to the facilities for fun and sports.","The village of Sattel is on the road over from Goldau and Schwyz towards Lake Aegeri and the upland valley of the Biber, in the direction of Einsiedeln and Lake Zurich. It was on the territory of Sattel, in the hamlet of Schornen by the Morgarten mountain, that a battle took place on 15 November 1315 between the Habsburgs and the people of Schwyz and their confederates, which went down in history as the “first freedom battle” fought by the Confederation. The Habsburg army was utterly wiped out. Today the Battle of Morgarten is remembered by a memorial on Lake Aegeri and a chapel.In winter, the region becomes a family-friendly winter sports area with 14 km of slopes and 20 km of cross-country ski tracks. For sledgers, careering from the Mostelberg to Sattel is a real adventure (and the run is even open at night on certain dates). Snow-shoe tours make for a wonderful day in the snow, rounded off with a fondue or “moonlight” menu.Sattel-Hochstuckli offers a really special cable-car experience: ""Stuckli Rondo"" is the first cable-car in the world to have revolving gondolas, taking passengers in comfort from Sattel up to ""Stuckli Run"" summer sledging run (with steep-sided bends and tunnels), to the jumping paradise of ""Stuckli Jump"" (trampoline and bouncy castle), the Engelstock adventure trail, the starting point for walks and hikes and to the mountain restaurants.There’s plenty of fun, sport and adventure in summer. The new pedestrian suspension bridge ""Raiffeisen Skywalk"" is the highlight of the Sattel-Hochstuckli adventure area. Visitors enjoy the experience of being on a suspension bridge on Europe’s longest pedestrian suspension bridge - which is 374 meters long and 58 meters high. The ""Raiffeisen Skywalk"" can be easily combined with circular hiking tours. It is also wheelchair- and stroller-friendly."

Schwyz and the area surrounding it, is famous for its cherry blossom and numerous cherry specialities. And Schwyz is also where the famous Swiss army penknives come from.","Switzerland owes its name and coat of arms to the town of Schwyz located between Lake Lucerne and the small Lake Lauerz. In 1291 the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden entered into an alliance, and in 1315, by winning the Battle of Morgarten, they managed to drive out the Austrians. The Museum of the Swiss Charters houses the most important documents of the early Swiss confederacy, including the confederation's founding document. And the Forum of Swiss History provides an opportunity for a multi-media experience of everyday life between 1300 and 1600.The people of Schwyz have not always been prosperous. From the 16th century onwards many of the canton's men were forced to serve as soldiers in foreign armies. They proved to be brave warriors, frequently returning home wealthy and in a position to build the proud houses which to this day are a feature of the town of Schwyz. A few individual Schwyz houses, such as the Hofstatt Ital Reding dating from 1609, are among the most magnificent secular buildings in Switzerland.Schwyz is also where the world-famous Swiss penknives come from: in excess of 25'000 of the red all-rounders leave production daily. It is hardly surprising then that the tourism destination surrounding Schwyz meanwhile goes under the name of ""Swiss Knife Valley"".Schwyz offers access to three welcoming ski resorts: Mythenregion, Stoos and Sattel-Hochstuckli. The valley station of the cable car to the Rotenflue/Mythenregion is just five minutes from the main square. All have a large array of offerings for skiers, snowboarders and especially for families. Winter-hikers and showshoers will find quiet paths off the pistes. Rustic mountain pubs entice visitors to tarry awhile.The impressive summits of the two legendary peaks immediately above Schwyz, the long-drawn-out ridge of the Rigi, famous ""Queen of Mountains"", or the nearby mountain holiday resort of Stoos with the Fronalpstock are just two among many mountain experiences available in the region. Schwyz is furthermore the gateway to the Muota Valley, a wild Karst mountain valley.Along 'Cherry Street', or Kirschstrasse, which runs through the hilly lakescape of the Alpine foothills and features a great many cherry tree orchards runs from Lucerne, via Zug and Schwyz, all the way to Brunnen on Lake Lucerne there are several opportunities to tour distilleries. Thanks to its central location, Schwyz is a good starting point for excursions to the most beautiful destinations of early Switzerland.The Mythenregion hiking area is very easy to reach; the valley station of the cable car to the Rotenflue is just five minutes from the main square."

The town is built on three hills, surrounded by vineyard-covered slopes, withLake Genevaat its feet. Rising impressively from the opposing French lakeshore are the Savoy Alps. The attractiveold townis largely car-free.

Finally, Lausanne is home to the world-famousBéjart Ballet.The «Olympic capital» is home to the Olympic Committee and alsothe Olympic Museum, the world’s largest information centre about the Olympic games. But sport in general is given a high profile here, examples of which are the «Lausanne Marathon» and «Athletissima», the international meeting for track and field athletics.Lausanne, the Olympic capital, is a centre renowned for its educational and research facilities, and is an unmissable destination for business tourism. The cradle of the Olympic movement teems with activities, creating a unique environment where the worlds of sport, culture, technology, medical research and innovation all come together. In terms of nature, the city opens out onto one of Switzerland’s most beautiful landscapes, with stunning panoramic views of Lake Geneva and the Alps.

Few regions offer as wide a variety of holiday pursuits as does the area surrounding Lake Geneva.Gently sloping vineyards border the shores of the lake, with the capital city of Lausanne across from the highest Alpine peaks. Lively towns and small wine-growing villages appear scattered at random. The region seems half dream and half reality, but the people in the farm villages who work the wheat fields on the plain above the lake, the inhabitants of the medieval towns and the original inhabitants of the castles have always had both feet planted firmly on the ground. In the quiet Vallé de Joux, nature remains unspoiled. The Jura mountains lie to the north and the Vaud Alps to the east, with lush pastures, chalet villages, mountain peaks and glaciers - as well as sunny ledges ready-made for a relaxed vacation and sporting adventures.Ideally located by Lake Geneva, the Canton of Vaud offers first-class conference facilities, excellent hotels and reassuring security.

The holiday region of Pays-d'Enhaut in the canton of Vaud is linked to the Lake Geneva region by the Col des Mosses and by the Montreux – Bernese Oberland Railway. Thanks to its favourable micro-climate, Château-d'Oex has developed into a hot-air ballooning metropolis. Passenger flights are available throughout the year and an international competition in hot-air ballooning is held every January.But the older traditions too have been retained: accordingly, the much-loved Alpine cheese of Etivaz is still made over an open wood fire. In Rougemont, many chalets dating back a hundred years bear testimony to the folk art of the region.Children too are fully catered for in the Pays-d'Enhaut. The themed trail about the life of ants on La Braye and a visit to the mineral and fossil collection in Rougemont are also highly enjoyable.The La Braye ski region of Château d'Oex has four ski lifts and 20 km of pistes. Thanks to the Videmanette cableway, Rougemont has a direct connection to the ski area of Gstaad. In winter, the railway also brings winter sports enthusiasts to the nearby ski areas of Schönried and Saanenmöser. The high plateau of Les Mosses – La Lécherette is very popular with cross-country skiers. 35 km of trails lead through snow-covered fields and forests. Further activities and facilities include snow-shoe treks, toboggan runs and winter walking trails.A beautiful pre-Alpine walking area lies south of Château-d'Oex: La Pierreuse, the largest nature conservation area in western Switzerland contains rock areas, forests, abundant flora and flat moors. For both leading bikers and amateurs, the Pays-d'Enhaut offers a large network of marked mountain biking trails along the tracks of the 1997 world championships. You can indulge in white-water sports on the fast-flowing river Saane: canyoning, hydrospeed, canoeing /kayaking and river rafting.

Even in summer, the Glacier 3000 ski region in the heart of the Vaud Alps offers skiing and glacier enjoyment over an expansive area.","In the Middle Ages, the rock wall of the mountain massif which surrounds the small village was regarded as a dangerous and cursed place where the devil did his worst. Accordingly, the place name of Les Diablerets also derives from the French ‘le Diable’, the devil. But no one need harbour any fears in Les Diablerets today, at the most some courage for the multitude of adventurous sports on offer. A varied, child-friendly programme of events and adjusted prices and infrastructure characterise the efforts that have been made to accommodate the needs of our younger guests.Three ski regions with a total of 125 km of pistes and a snow park extend up to an altitude of 3000 metres . The cross-country network of tracks consists of 30 kilometers of classical Nordic track and 15 kilometers of skating trails. Further attractions include a 7.2 km long toboggan run, snow-shoe walks, snow biking and ice fall climbing. Last but not least, the glacier restaurant constructed by leading Swiss architect Mario Botta in the Glacier 3000 ski region offers a unique panorama of the Lake Geneva region.Active guests in particular will get their money’s worth in Les Diablerets. Skiing and snowboarding until well into the early summer in the glacier ski region of Glacier 3000 offer competition to a wide range of adventure sports: canyoning, hydro speed, paragliding, dirt monster biking (a cross between mountain biking and motorcycling), tyrolienne traversing, or the highest Alpine Coaster (toboggan run on tracks) at the Glacier 3000 mountain station. The «Indiana» fun obstacle course and fixed rope routes round off the activities.But traditional sports are certainly also on offer: walking (250 km of walking trails) and mountain biking. And excursions to the Aigle viticultural museum not far from Lake Geneva, the Bex salt mine in the lower Valais, or by postal bus across the Col du Pillon to the nearby sophisticated resort of Gstaad are always worthwhile.From June to October, the resorts Les Diablerets and Villars-Gryon in the Vaudoise Alps offer guests unrestricted access to all types of mountain transportation, and to over 30 sports and cultural activities."

Activities enjoyed here include rowing or riding on the summer toboggan run.The rich mountain flora with orchids, gentian and edelweiss, the herds of sheep and cows grazing on the Alps and the wild animals on the mountain slopes attract nature lovers to the lake at the entrance to the Unesco World Heritage Site.

In winter the emphasis is on Nordic ski sports.","Kandersteg is characterised by a broad spectrum of accommodation: from 4-star superior hotel to holiday apartments, camping sites through to international scout centre with dormitories there is everything. Several mountain guesthouses and huts belonging to the Swiss Alpine Club in the Lötschberg holiday region provide the basis for several-day mountain tours. Especially noteworthy is the culinary scene – in Kandersteg there are three award-winning restaurants.Kandersteg is a snow-sure cross-country skiing paradise. Over 50 kilometres of tracked trails (classic and skating) are available in the valley floor and on the sun terraces. Downhill skiers are catered for at Lake Oeschinen and at Sunnbüel. The ski areas appeal to beginners, laid-back skiers and families.The Kandersteg artificial ice rink is ideal for skating and curling.

With its 72 thundering waterfalls, secluded valleys, colourful alpine meadows and lonely mountain inns, the Lauterbrunnen Valley is one of the biggest nature conservation areas in Switzerland.","The very name ‘Lauter Brunnen’ (‘many fountains’) suggests the magnificence of this landscape. There are 72 waterfalls in the Lauterbrunnen Valley, the most famous being the Staubbach Falls. Plunging almost 300 metres from an overhanging rock face, they are one of the highest free-falling waterfalls in Europe. In 1779, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the valley, and was inspired by the roaring waters to write his well-known poem ‘Spirit song over the waters’Another deafening natural phenomenon are the Trümmelbach Falls in the ‘Black Monk’ mountain, hidden behind mighty rock faces. Up to 20,000 litres of water per second cascade over the ten glacier falls from a total height of about 200 metres. This spectacle can only be reached in summer by tunnel lift.The expansive ski regions of Wengen-Kleine Scheidegg and Mürren-Schilthorn are quickly reached by mountain railway. There are 45 transport facilities altogether in the Jungfrau region as well as 213 km of piste, fun parks, 100 km of winter hiking trails and 50 km of toboggan run. The Lauterbrunnen Valley also boasts plenty of cross-country ski trails.The valley town of Lauterbrunnen (795 m) is the starting point for some of the best known excursion destinations in the Jungfrau region. A rack railway links Lauterbrunnen with the sunny terrace of Wengen on the eastern flank of the Lauterbrunnen Valley and the Kleinen Scheidegg, the station where you change trains for the onward journey to the Jungfraujoch.On the opposite side of the valley is the holiday resort of Mürren, accessible from Lauterbrunnen and Stechelberg. The cableway from Stechelberg continues to the peak of the Schilthorn at 2971 m, famous for being the setting where the 007 classic, ‘On Her Majesty’s Secret Service’ was filmed.A few kilometres further up the valley from Lauterbrunnen, accessible along a narrow mountain road, is the peaceful little mountain village of Isenfluh, perched on a steep rock terrace at 1024 m, and starting point for walks in the romantic Saustal and further to Mürren and the Lobhorn mountains."

","Thun lies at the north-western end ofLake Thun, and is the gateway to the Bernese Oberland. The River Aare, which flows from Lake Thun to Bern, shapes the cityscape of the eleventh-largest city in Switzerland with some 44,000 inhabitants.The city’s most famous landmark is the mightyThun Castle, with its tower that was built between 1180 and 1190, which towers majestically over the Old Town. A historical museum is housed in the tower rooms, showcasing finds from the past 800 years relating to the region and its history, as well as a special exhibition which changes each year. Pride of place goes to the restored 12th-century knights’ hall, however. The view from the castle tower of the mountains and the lake is also unparalleled.The historical raised promenades inThun’s old townare yet another highlight. But they are not the only reason to enjoy a stroll through the cobblestone streets. As well as traditional rows of houses, Thun is home to various small shops on different levels that invite visitors to browse and explore.Thanks to its enormous diversity, the city of Thun is worth a visit at any time of the year: While the charming old town and the delightful river and lakeside promenade are bursting with life in the spring, cultural open-air events such as the popularLake Thun Festivalget everyone in the mood for a summer of fun.Autumn, on the other hand, is the ideal season in which to get in touch with your artistic side, whether at theThun Art Museumor theThun Panoramain Schadau Park, an imposing panoramic painting of the city from 1814. And then again, walkers have always been particularly drawn to the coldest season too, with its wintry lakeside landscapes, and which offers the perfect opportunity for fine diners to enjoy the culinary delights on offer in the city’s many restaurants.Christmas is the perfect time for a shopping trip through Thun’s festively dressed old town. And the Christmas market on Waisenhausplatz is a popular spot to meet for a chat over a mug of mulled wine. After an active winter’s day, the numerous restaurants, especially along the banks of the Aare, offer the perfect place in which to enjoy culinary delights and pleasant company. Even in the winter season, a boat sails on Lake Thun every day. So it is still possible to explore the city and region from the water at this time of year. Thanks to its outstanding transport links, Thun is also an ideal starting point for numerous winter activities throughout the entire Bernese Oberland holiday region.Thun is also known as the summer capital of Switzerland. With mountains, rivers and the magnificent lake on its doorstep, Thun is a paradise for sports enthusiasts, sun worshipers and keen swimmers. You can even go surfing right in the heart of the city. But the opportunity to enjoy a spot of indulgence is always just around the corner too. Whether that’s strolling through the old town, enjoying an aperitif on Mühleplatz or a delicious dinner on the banks of the Aare. Another particularly special way to enjoy a hot summer’s day is with a boat trip on Lake Thun or Lake Brienz. On Lake Thun, the “Blümlisalp” paddle steamer transports its passengers back in time to the days of the magnificent Belle Époque. But all 14 of the boats that operate on the two lakes offer breathtaking views of the three world-famous peaks, the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau."

Wine-growing and cultural events are both of great importance here. Thanks to its central position, Siders is also an ideal starting point for lots of excursions.","Siders is advantageously positioned on the border between Upper and Lower Valais and on the language border between French and German. The Romans called it ""the town of a hundred hills"". On some of these hills, castles and fortresses were built and settlements grew up round about them. Today, these settlements have joined together to form the little town of Siders. At its heart are the richly decorated Town Hall and the picturesque Rue du Bourg, lined with historic houses and the parish church of Ste-Catherine.Many artists have fallen in love with the location and culture of the town. Perhaps the most well-known of them was Rainer Maria Rilke, who was so enthusiastic about the town and its surroundings that he lived here from 1921 until he died in 1926. There is a museum dedicated to the German-speaking writer.The area around Siders is one of Switzerland's most important wine-growing regions. The Fendant, made of the Chasselas grape, is the most famous product of the Valais. The equivalent for red wines is the Dôle from Pinot Noir grapes. If you take the Vineyard Trail, (which links the two sites of the Valais Wine and Vineyard Museum), you will learn more about the region's fine wines.Over 640 selected Grand Crus from more than 102 vineyards are ready for winetasting in the Oenotheque at the Château de Villa.

The well-signed UNESCO trail leads into one of the largest nature reserves in Switzerland, an area that captivates with its isolation and the wilderness of the Alpine landscape. The whole region is surrounded by an impressive panorama of peaks of 3000 and 4000 metres. Relaxation in the fresh mountain air, and the opportunity to experience nature up close, are guaranteed here. The three isolated “candle hotels” are only accessible on foot and offer the possibility of a very nostalgic over-night stay."
Mürren,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/muerren/,46.55988,7.89329,"«My name is Bond, James Bond.» The agent who presented himself in such an unmistakeable way made a decisive contribution to the fame of the Schilthorn. The mountain with its breathtaking panoramic views is today one of the top attractions of the Jungfrau region. Lying at the foot of the Schilthorn, Mürren has nevertheless remained a cosy mountain village.","Mürren – a former settlement of people from the Lötschen valley in the Valais, which still remains recognisable today from the design of the houses and the pronunciation of the Mürren dialect – is the highest, continually inhabited village settlement in the canton of Bern and lies on a terrace at 1650 metres, high above the Lauterbrunnen valley. A double-cable ropeway leads up onto the plateau from Lauterbrunnen, while a cableway runs from Stechelberg, past turbulent waterfalls and craggy rock faces, into the centre of the car-free village of Mürren, and further to the Schilthorn at 2970 metres.At the end of the 1960s, the makers of the Bond film “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” were immediately taken by the futuristic revolving restaurant on the Schilthorn: the scenes involving the imaginary ‘Piz Gloria’ had to be shot here… The film became a great success, the Schilthorn cableway and the revolving restaurant equally so. The magnificent 360° panorama from the summit takes in the world-renowned Alpine triumvirate of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau, reaching right to Mont Blanc and into the Black Forest.The winter sports region of Mürren-Schilthorn has 53 km of prepared ski and snowboard pistes, toboggan runs and a network of winter walking trails. Beyond the Lauterbrunnen valley, a further 30 or so cableways and lifts, and 160 km of pistes in the other ski areas of the Jungfrau region can also be used. There is an 11 km cross-country ski trail in the valley between Stechelberg and Lauterbrunnen.Impressive views of the opposing mountain summits can also be enjoyed from Mürren. The holiday resort is the starting point for walks (200 km of walking trails), excursions and experiences. A funicular leads to the Allmendhubel, immediately above the village at an altitude of 1907 metres. Themed walks such as the North Face Trail, providing historical mountaineering information on the north faces, and the Flower Panorama Trail invite visitors to discover the region. Playgrounds and picnic areas are provided for families with children.More demanding tours lead into the nature reserve at the rear of the Lauterbrunnen valley, as well as through the Sefinen valley and over the Sefinenfurgge pass into the neighbouring Kiental."

A total of more than 40 percent of the ski runs are equipped with snow-making machines. In the Jungfrau Region however, non-skiers also get their money’s worth: 100 kilometres of winter footpaths enable you to explore the mountains on foot. Furthermore, with its countless toboggan runs, the region is a real paradise for tobogganing. Amongst them is the longest toboggan run in the Alps.In summer you can choose from over 500 km of marked walking, hiking and mountain paths. The crystal-blue mountain lakes and gushing waterfalls provide a welcome refreshment.

This mountainscape and the numerous lookout points and activities make Grindelwald one of the most popular and cosmopolitan holiday and excursion destinations in Switzerland, and the largest ski resort in the Jungfrau region.","Thanks to its magnificent vista and the glacier which once reached right into the basin, Grindelwald attracted its first guests – primarily the English – from the end of the 18th century onwards. The actual breakthrough of Alpinism occurred in the mid 19th century, and local mountain guides climbed the peaks of the region with English tourists. The first ascent of the Eiger, the most difficult of Alpine mountains took place in 1858 (the north face only in 1938).Road and railway construction made Grindelwald much more accessible towards the end of the 19th century, which in turn also heralded the onset of winter tourism. The first cableway in the Alps was built here in 1908 on the Wetterhorn. And in 1912, a railway reached theJungfraujochviaKleine Scheidegg; today the «Top of Europe» still remains Europe’s highest railway station and a world-renowned excursion destination within permanent snow and ice.WinterThe two ski regions of First and Kleine Scheidegg –Männlichen–Wengenoffer 160 kilometres of pistes with around 30 lifts reaching up to an altitude of 2500 m.

The charm of bilingualism, the intact old town and its location as the gateway to the three peripheral Jura lakes (Lakes Biel, Neuchâtel and Murten) make the town an attractive starting point, but also a destination for excursions.","Biel is the largest Swiss city in which German and French are equally spoken. One senses the relaxed mentality here resulting from the mixture of these two languages. In 2002, Biel was one of the four exhibition locations for EXPO.Architecturally, Biel is a town of many facets. The modern part of the city with its high-rise buildings lies at lake level which then gives way, on a slight incline, to the intact old town with its gothic town church stemming from the 15th century. In 2004, Biel was awarded the Wakker Prize by the Swiss Heritage Society for the exemplary manner in which it conserved its, in part, outstanding stock of 20th century buildings. Examples can be found in the new town, where uniform districts built in the ‘new construction’ style came into being in the 1920s and ‘30s.The town of Biel is a tradition-imbued watch metropolis in which this Swiss craft is still fostered.Swatch, Rolex,Omega, Tissot, Movado and Mikron are all located here. Biel has additionally also positioned itself in the field of other industries and in communication. Its location makes the town an attractive gateway to the excursion and holiday region around Lakes Biel, Neuchâtel and Murten – also known as the “Three Lakes Region” – with vineyards on the hillsides and extensive vegetable cultivation on the level areas. The options for rambling and cycling excursions are huge. On the North Shore of Lake Biel the vineyard trail and the viticulture museum in Ligerz attract visitors. Several attractive mediaeval small towns like Nidau, Twann, La Neuveville and Erlach are well worth an excursion.The lakes and the Aare River can be cruised on various routes aboard regularly scheduled ships. Thethree-lake-cruiseis particularly popular.From the town on the linguistic divide, it is only a stone’s throw to the lush green, hilly landscape of the Jura with its broad forests and wonderful vantage points, as well as the sportsperson’s Mecca of Magglingen above Biel, and the Chasseral (1607m).Tour of the old town of BielOff we go through the old town of Biel.

Romans also left their mark - and nobility and bishops ruled from here in the Middle Ages.In Rousseau's time the peninsula was a modest estate with vineyard section on lease - which gained European significance during the 18th century owing to his description.

It borders the southern edge of the Jura, where the slopes are used for intensive cultivation of vines.","The best way to see the region is to take a boat ride on Lake Biel/Bienne. The fleet consists of eight boats, including the world’s largest solar-powered catamaran, the “MobiCat”. Every Sunday in summer you can go for a brunch trip on this extraordinary boat, powered entirely by solar energy. The programme of the Lake Biel/Bienne shipping company also includes other special trips such as exotic culinary tours, musical boats, comedy or murder mystery trips and romantic rides under the full moon.From Biel/Bienne, the largest bilingual town in Switzerland, the service boats travel along the northern shore, lined with delightful little wine-making villages, as far as the romantic St. Peter’s Island. Part of this idyllic peninsula is a nature conservation area, providing a perfect habitat for numerous birds.For a closer look at the work of the wine-makers, you can walk along the Vineyard Way from Biel to La Neuveville. The many excellent and informative signs along the path on the northern side of the lake document the history of vines and wine-growing in this sunny region. The path through the vineyards also offers lots of viewpoints over the lake, St. Peter’s Island and the distant Alps. On the way, you may be tempted to stop in picturesque villages like Twann and Ligerz, perhaps for a wine-tasting or to visit the Wine Museum in Ligerz.There are not only footpaths but also tracks for cyclists and rollerbladers round the lake. There are lots of opportunities to rest or swim along the way, and you also have the option of shortening the route by hopping on a boat.High above Lake Biel/Bienne lies the Plateau de Diesse. This little known plateau and the Twann Gorge leading down to the lake were chosen by the author Friedrich Dürrenmatt as the scene of the crime in his novel “Der Richter und sein Henker” (The Judge and his Hangman). More ambitious hikers and bikers can climb from here up to the Chasseral.And those looking for a new experience can now explore the lake by “stand up paddling”. The board you use for this is similar to a surf board, except that you are not lying down and using your hands to move forward but, rather, you are standing and using a long bladed paddle."

Jura & Three-Lakes,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/jura-threelakes/,46.99657,6.93602,"The region ""Jura & Three-Lakes"" is famous for its great variety of landscapes, its intact and well-protected nature, its history and rich architectural heritage which is often related to the watch-making industry.","The mountains of Neuchâtel seem just like a green paradise between the blue sky and lake. Le Creux du Van and the asphalt mines in the Val-de-Travers as well as the towns of La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle, which were recognized by UNESCO in June 2009 for their remarkable watch-making heritage, are always worth a visit.Marked by nature and tradition, the Bernese Jura offers its visitors an abundance of free spaces between valleys, mountains and meadows of flowers, the ideal place for hiking. The Chasseral, highest point of the region, is a nature reserve. From its summit at an altitude of 1607 m, you can enjoy an incredible all-around panorama across lakes and valleys.The spacious canton of Jura, situated at an altitude of 1000 m, is the meeting place of man and horse. Rivers flow gently along plains and hills, then tumble into impressive gorges. Discover some wonders of nature such as the nature reserve Clos-du-Doubs or the high plain of the Franches-Montagnes.How can one best describe the Three-Lakes district? It makes you think of nature, vegetable plantations, vineyards, modern towns, picturesque villages, the mixture of the German and French languages, but also of water. As a matter of fact, a boat trip on the lakes of Biel, Murten and Neuchâtel or the river Aare is an unforgettable experience. The great classic cruise, the Three-Lakes Tour, should not be missed in any case.Bikers also appreciate the Three-Lakes district. Two national routes run across it, and many other trails invite to enjoy the sport at all levels. The trails leading through the vegetable plantations are especially suitable for families.The diversity of the towns is quite striking too. First of all Solothurn, the most beautiful baroque town of Switzerland, then Murten and its historic town wall, Estavayer-le-Lac, the medieval town per se, Neuchâtel at the foot of the vineyards and Biel, the watch-makers‘ town with its many unrecognized historic and architectural treasures. Visitors will be enchanted by all these riches."
The Bernese Jura,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/the-bernese-jura/,47.27832,7.36953,"On the borders of the Jura Mountains Area is the Bernese Jura a welcome land which invites you to live the nature. Between lake and mountain, forest and pasture, the richness of the fauna and the variety of the flora, your curiosity will be aroused! Relaxation place or land of adventure, the Bernese Jura offers you an escapist space to go in for sport all year round.","In the heart of Jura & Three-Lakes, the Bernese Jura has a rich heritage, reflection of a culture with contrasted and varied influences. Land of traditions where the horse of the Franches-Montagnes area is king, the Bernese Jura is also the watchmaking cradle and a space of competences in aid of an advanced technology.With the passing of the seasons, the area offers many culinary specialities cooked with the local products. The gastronomy resources of the Bernese Jura are real and varied. From the prestigious restaurant to the typical and traditional farm restaurant, the gourmet will be able to satisfy all the demands of its palate."
Bern,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/bern/,46.94796,7.44744,"Not many cities have managed to retain their historic features quite as successfully as Bern, the capital of Switzerland. The old town of Bern is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and thanks to its 6 kilometres of arcades - the locals refer to them as 'Lauben' - boasts on of the longest weather-sheltered shopping promenades in Europe. ","The medieval air of this city with its many fountains, sandstone facades, narrow streets and historic towers is unique. The elevatedRose Gardenabove theBear Parkand the platform of the 101-metre-highcathedraltower offer the best views of theold townround which the RiverAareflows. The former entrenchments and bastions drop down steeply to the river. The boutiques, bars and cabaret stages of the old town, some of which are located in vaulted cellars, and the small street cafes attract locals as well as a lot of tourists. Although Bern has a very good public transport network it is best to explore the city centre on foot.TheZentrum Paul Kleesituated on the outskirts of the city houses the most comprehensive collection of works by the artist Paul Klee. TheAlbert Einstein Housebears testimony to the physics genius' stay in Bern at the start of the 20th century and may ideally be combined with a visit to the Einstein Museum. With theHistory Museum,Art Museum,Swiss Alpine MuseumandCommunication MuseumBern offers a very varied range of exhibitions.Bern is the seat of Switzerland's government. TheHouses of Parliament(Bundeshaus) rise above the city just a stone's throw away from the railway station. The doors to the Houses of Parliament are open to visitors most of the time, and if you're lucky you might even bump into a member of parliament in the streets of the city.In summer the River Aare provides an opportunity for the ultimatebathing experience; very good, experienced swimmers allow themselves to drift along in the clean Aare while enjoying a view of the Houses of Parliament. The Botanical Gardens are also located along the river, as is theDählhölzliZoo and the old Matte district. Bern and bears, the cities heraldic beast, are inseparable. A visit to the Bear Park, habitat of a family of bears, is a must-do.In the squares of the city centre colourful weekly markets present their wares. TheOnion Market(Zibelemärit) which takes place on the fourth Monday in November is particularly worth visiting: visitors to the traditional market dedicated to onions start pouring into the city in the early hours.Set in the heart of Switzerland, Bern is the gateway to the Alps. The capital city may easily be reached by car or by air via the Bern-Belp Airport and bus links to the city centre. Visitors who prefer to travel by train may take advantage of the dense rail network with its direct connections to the major European cities. Bern’s central location makes it the perfect base for overnight accommodation and for excursions throughout Switzerland.Safety, transport links, infrastructure and local attractions are the reasons why the region around the Swiss capital is the second strongest economic area in Switzerland. The real secret behind Bern’s success, however, is its relaxed atmosphere. This may be due to the Swiss capital’s legendary charm, the interplay between visionary architecture and its world-famous UNESCO-listed old town. Bern offers an enormous variety of locations for business events all within easy walking distance – from historic vaulted cellars such as the Kornhauskeller to cultural and architectural gems such as the Zentrum Paul Klee or the ultra-modern Kursaal Bern conference centre."

Exciting exhibitions and performances recall the era of knights in shining armor and the life of the noble Habsburg family – all with roots in Aargau.

As the moated heart of Switzerland, Aargau has a wealth of scenic gems; a remarkable wetland landscape where the Reuss and Limmat unite with the River Aare to henceforth carry water from a 40% catchment area of Switzerland. Active leisure and welcome relaxation are also within reach with a visit to a regional nature park of national importance, the Aargau Jura Park.Water & WellnessPurest relaxation at the Rheinfelden, Zurzach and Schinznach thermal baths does a world of good – and in hot sulphur springs, the kind you expect to find solely in Iceland, you sink into water of up to 45 degrees Celsius with Switzerland’s highest sulphur content. Rambling journeys of discovery are also enjoyed exploring the protected wetlands – and plenty of rare plants and native animals such as the busy beaver can be seen along the banks of the river. In fact, this, the area referred to as the moated heart of Switzerland is where the Aare, Reuss and Limmat rivers merge to form a giant pool that in some ways recalls the Amazon.Research & High-techThe award bearing «Umwelt Arena» – a world premier as interactive arena for environmental topics and conscious living, provides some surprising answers to everyday questions. And equally as interesting are visits to Switzerland’s largest institute of nature and engineering science, the Paul Scherrer Institute, or the Axporama visitor’s center - with an interactive display of our lives in terms of energy.

It's for this reason that Aarau is regarded as the town of beautiful gables.And Aarau continues to display an appreciation of art: the Aargau Art Museum featuring an extension designed by the famous architects Herzog & de Meuron offers architecture and art exhibitions setting high standards. The «Naturama», Aargau nature museum, is not your run-of-the-mill museum: animals, plants, exciting video films highlight the interaction and areas of conflict between nature and man in Aargau.The Roggenhausen Wildlife Park has wild animals in their natural habitat as well as a Nature Trail. Cycling and walking trails alongside the River Aare and the Jura slopes provide the perfect opportunity for some pleasant physical exercise. But to see the people of Aargau really enjoying themselves you need to come to one of the local and historic traditional events, such as the «Maienzug» in July, the «Bachfischet» or «Rüeblimärt».The Canton of Aargau boasts a great many castles, including some of Switzerland's most impressive such as the Lenzburg, the Hallwyl Water Castle and the Habsburg Castle - main residence of the famous dynasty from the the 10th century onwards.

Nevertheless, St. Moritz first became famous thanks to its mineral springs, which were discovered 3,000 years ago and established the town as a summer spa resort early on.","St. Moritz, which is in the Upper Engadine, at an elevation of 1,856 m, boasts plenty of sunny days. It was exactly this sun that was legally protected as the emblem of St. Moritz in 1930. St. Moritz was often ahead of the times - for example, the first electric light went on at Christmastime in 1878, the first golf tournament in the Alps took place here, in 1889 and one of the first ski lifts in Switzerland began running in 1935.Guests from all over the world appreciate the modern Alpine lifestyle, characterised by top-class restaurants that can satisfy gourmet demands even by the side of the slopes, hotels that set standards in every category, and events of international calibre. The Via Serlas guarantees great shopping in a small space, though you can also find local specialities like the famous Engadine nut tart just around the corner.Sights such as the leaning tower, a remnant of the Mauritius Church from around 1500, or the Segantini Museum, offer a change from the life of luxury and the jet set.154 years ago, the hotelier Johannes Badrutt made a bold bet with his English summer guests, promising them mild Engadine sunshine in mid-winter. Badrutt won the bet and St. Moritz went on to become one of the world's most exceptional winter sports resorts.For winter sports enthusiasts there are 350 kilometres of pistes with a state-of-the-art infrastructure in the surrounding area. St. Moritz's 'house mountain', the Corviglia, boasts the steepest start slope in Switzerland with the Piz Nair Wall's 100 per cent vertiginous drop. Toboggan riders plunge down the icy run which is one of the oldest natural ice bob runs in the world. For winter hikers there are 150 km of winter walking trails and for cross-country skiers there is a track network of about 200 km. The snowboard fun park, curling and altitude training are just some of the other winter sports facilities.As well as traditional hiking and mountain biking, guests can also try their hand at sailing, rowing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, tennis, minigolf or horse riding. The Ludains Ice Arena is also open to skaters throughout the summer, while golfers will find an Alpine paradise with four courses in the surrounding area. Romantic carriage rides around the lake, through the Staz forest or the grand town itself are among the highlights of a stay in St. Moritz.

How about a gourmet dinner far away from the crowds? Learn about the rich culture of Switzerland's eastern-most holiday region and its capital Chur, the oldest town in the country. Or why not simply relax in a traditional spa? Try Telemark skiing, parabol skiing or snow golf – putting a red ball on a white «green». In Graubünden, all of this is possible – and much more.Graubünden has every colour: Red for the Rhätische Bahn railway, yellow for the postal buses, blue for its 615 lakes and the skies above 150 valleys, green for forests and pastures, golden brown for larch trees in autumn, grey for castles and rocks, and white for snow and ice.Choose red to take the Rhätische Bahn to Klosters, Davos, Arosa, St. Moritz, the Surselva region, the Engadine and Valposchiavo. Choose yellow and see Savognin and the Müstair valley, Lenzerheide, and the Mesolcina and Bregaglia valleys by postal bus. Pick grey for climbing a sheer rock face, and white for storming peaks and traversing glaciers. Or simply sit down on a patch of green and enjoy azure skies above."

Scuol,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/scuol/,46.79865,10.30388,"The Scuol, Bad Tarasp-Vulpera, Sent and Ftan region is truly spoiled for sunshine. It lies cradled between the peaks of the Silvretta range and the ""Engadin Dolomites"". This holiday area has retained its native cultural values and its natural surroundings intact - to the great pride of the Engadiners and the benefit of their guests.","Engadine houses with ornate sgraffito characterise the old parts of the village. The Büglgrond and Plaz squares with their mineral springs are also worth a visit. The late Gothic church of St. George with a Romanesque tower stands on a mighty rock, offering a rewarding view across Scuol and into the Swiss National Park.14 cable railways whisk winter sports visitors up into the high Alpine ski area of Motta Naluns. Gentle pistes alternate with testing mogul fields and wide powder-covered slopes. Connoisseurs speak highly of the 12 km long ""dream piste"" down to Scuol or Sent, while the more daring rave about the Snow and Fun Park.With its Bogn Engiadina Scuol health and bathing centre, and the first Turkish bath in Switzerland, Scuol has developed into one of the major holiday, wellness and health destinations.Skiing and snowboarding in Engadin's national park region Scuol Samnaun: the range of winter sport locations in Lower Engadin ranges from Minschuns (Val Müstair), which is small but special and something of an insider tip, to the family-friendly ski area of Motta Naluns (Engadin Scuol), right through to the international Silvretta Ski Arena (Samnaun/Ischgl) with over 200 kilometres of slopes.Around the innovative holiday and spa resort of Scuol – where mineral water bubbles from the village fountain – stretches an unspoilt landscape of national-park quality. The authentic Engadin holiday villages have managed to retain their traditional identity, and are proud to show guests their rich Romansh culture. The valley may lie at the end of the railway line and far from day-tripper traffic, but it has also frequently been a pioneer of new ideas.The “Engadin Bad Scuol” health and activity baths, opened in 1993, will leave you wanting for nothing. A piece of paradise - a parcel of freedom and quality of life. Switzerland’s first Roman-Irish baths, with their bathing ritual of several hours duration and a stimulating soap-and-brush massage, constitute an attraction of a very special kind. The scenery in which the baths and sauna are set provides a magnificent view of the impressive mountains - bathing at its most enjoyable.There are more than twenty mineral springs in and around Scuol. Ten of these are currently in use and supply both Scuol’s drinking cures and carbonated mineral baths as well as the Engadine Bad Scuol. Steam baths at various temperatures combined with the hot dry air of a sauna conspire to make this a real highlight.The Swiss National Park, Tarasp Castle, the Engadine Bad Scuol with Switzerland’s first Roman-Irish bath, authentic Engadine villages with lots of historic buildings and a rich Romansch culture – these are just some of the many assets the Lower Engadine has to offer.Here, you can immerse yourself in the warmth of the large indoor pool, relax in the jacuzzi or let yourself drift on the salty waters of the saline bath. The outdoor pool has the added advantage of superb views of the Lower Engadine Dolomites and Piz Pisoc, the highest mountain in the Swiss National Park.The Roman-Irish bathing ritual combines two distinct European bathing traditions. While the Romans swore by the relaxing properties of steam baths at various temperatures, the Ancient Irish placed their faith in hot, dry air. Nineteenth century bathing culture combined these two styles in a single ritual. A soap and brush massage to cleanse the skin and stimulate the circulation and body creaming station are all part of the ritual. It ends in the dimmed light of the relaxation room where guests, wrapped snugly in a warm blanket, can bask in the beauty of the mountains of the Lower Engadine."

From Göschenen station on the Gotthard line, the rack-and-pinion Schöllenenbahn climbs steeply up to Andermatt, where it meets the east-west route across the Alps of the Matterhorn-Gotthard line (with the Glacier Express), going towards either Valais or Grisons.

You have to book in advance for an exclusive nostalgia ride over the Gotthard Pass on a traditional post coach, drawn by a five-horse team.Different languages and cultures havealways come together in Andermatt, and for centuries, people from all overthe world have found their way to the Ursern Valley. Situated betweenpeaks and passes, lakes and cliffs, this place truly serves as a central hubbetween cantons, countries and various cultures."

The town acts as a gateway to Italy for those travelling from the North, and the keyhole to the Alps for those coming from the South.The picturesque corners and squares, the courtyards and the neo-Classical, Italian-style theatre, and the sympathetically restored old houses tell visitors the history of what is culturally a Lombardy town. In its alleyways are richly decorated patrician houses and beautiful churches. Yet behind the austere charm of the medieval town is all the dynamic life of a modern meeting-place. Numerous boutiques, cafés and specialist shops offering culinary delicacies invite you to linger and window-shop. Each Saturday there is a big weekly market in the historical city center.The fortifications of Bellinzona are among the most important examples of medieval defensive architecture in the Alps, and have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since the year 2000. From the Castelgrande, Bellinzona's oldest and mightiest castle, there is a beautiful view over the Old Town and the surrounding area. A little museum in the Castelgrande documents the history of Bellinzona's castles and town centre. There are also museums in the other two castles.It was the Romans who realised the strategic importance of the site, and first built a castle here, in the first century A.D. In the Middle Ages this was extended to form a long, impregnable fortress. Because of its location, Bellinzona was always a bone of contention between the Dukes of Milan and the Swiss. It was only in 1516 that the town first became part of the Swiss Federation.Bellinzona is ideally located for excursions to the nearby holiday resorts of Locarno and Ascona, over Monte Ceneri to the southern Tessin with its main town, Lugano, up the romantic side valleys of the Tessin or northwards into the Leventina, with the Bedretto valley, or into the sunny Blenio valley.The “Tre Castelli” are the symbol of Ticino’s capital, and form a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Lugano,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/lugano/,46.00401,8.95086,"Lugano, the largest town in the holiday region of Ticino, is not only Switzerland's third most important financial centre and a conference, banking and business centre, but also a town of parks and flowers, villas and sacred buildings. With Mediterranean flair, Lugano offers all the advantages of a world-class city, combined with the cachet of a small town.","Lugano lies in a bay on the northern side ofLake Lugano, surrounded by numerous mountains offering splendid viewpoints. The traffic-free historic town centre, the numerous buildings in Italianate Lombardy style, the exclusive museums, the mountains, lake and a packed calendar of events all invite visitors to see the sights, soak up the atmosphere – and enjoy ""dolce far niente"". Thanks to its mild climate, Lugano is a popular tourist destination in the spring when the camellias are in bloom.The town centre with its Mediterranean-style squares and arcades, and numerous parks with sub-tropical plants such as the Parco Civico on the shores of the lake invite you to laze around, enjoying the atmosphere. By the lakeside promenade are the Belvedere Gardens, where the parkland boasts not only camellias and magnolias but also countless sub-tropical plants and modern works of art.Art connoisseurs are attracted to this city of art and architecture by the high standard of the exhibitions it hosts. In theMASI (Museo d’Arte della Svizzera Italiana)are paintings by Klee, Jawlensky, Renoir and Degas, among others. In the last 50 years, theTicino region, and Lugano in particular, have developed into an important region for architecture. The most well-known representatives of the ""Ticino School"" are Luigi Snozzi and Mario Botta. EFG Bank AG, the Palazzo Ransila (Via Pretorio) and his own workshop on the Via Ciani are good examples.The two closest mountains to Lugano,Monte San SalvatoreandMonte Brè, give you an outstanding panorama of the town, Lake Lugano and the alpine scenery. From Monte Brè there is a walk down to the village of Brè, which has preserved its typical Ticino village centre, and enhanced it with works of art. From the San Salvatore another popular walk leads down through the beautifully situated Carona to Lake Lugano atMorcote. Taking a boat trip back to Lugano is a splendid way to round off the day. Other excursions are to the fishing village of Gandria, up the Monte San Giorgio or theMonte Generosoor to the Lilliput world ofSwitzerland in Miniatureat Melide.Enjoy the Mediterranean temperatures, palm and olive trees. If you really want to relax, just sit at a table in one of the squares. And do what everyone does here: eat, chat and enjoy life."

Morcote,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/morcote/,45.9233,8.91749,The former fishing village of Morcote is situated on the shore of Lake Lugano and is undoubtedly one of the most frequently photographed places in Ticino. It was not without just cause that picturesque Morcote was voted Switzerland's most beautiful village in 2016.,"The overall appearance of Morcote is characterised by its division into two parts: a secular part on the Lake and an ecclesiastical part on the slope. Both parts have their own characteristic buildings.The bank of the lake is lined with numerous imposing buildings such as Palazzo Paleari, as well as a number of simple buildings. The row of houses by the lake, with their magnificent arcades, is one of the most distinctive features of Morcote and characterises the view of the village from the lake in particular. Just behind these, the winding, cobbled laneways of the village centre unfold. Even today, these still clearly reveal its mediaeval origins.From here, a spectacular Way of the Cross leads up about 400 steps to the pilgrimage church of Santa Maria del Sasso. A beautiful stream and multiple wayside shrines accompany those making the ascent. Once you arrive at the top, the church sits enthroned like a patroness, presiding over the village. There is also an octagonal chapel and a historic cemetery, in which a number of internationally prominent figures are interred. The pilgrimage church contains frescoes from various eras, a beautiful stone dome and an organ built in 1700 to admire. In addition, visitors can drink in a breathtaking view of the village and the lake from up here.One rather exotic attraction in Morcote is Scherrer Park, which was created by the St Gallen textile trader, Hermann Arthur Scherrer. The flourishing subtropical vegetation of this park includes palm trees, camellias, cypresses, bamboo and many other fragrant plants. The park is open to the public and attracts visitors not only through its plants, but also through the cultural and artistic events it hosts.ISOSISOS is the Federal Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites of national importance. The inventory is maintained by the Federal Office of Culture (FOC) and lists the most significant settlements in Switzerland. Today, some 1,200 places are included in the inventory, from hamlets right through to cities. The inventory provides information on the development and identity of the settlements listed in it, thereby contributing to the preservation of architectural diversity in Switzerland and promoting both sustainable planning and a high-quality Baukultur."

It owes its timeless beauty to its narrow streets, enchanting postcard settings and picturesque historic buildings. The arcades of the noble antique villas, major architectural monuments and lush subtropical vegetation welcome both visitors and residents. The Church of Santa Maria del Sasso, the grand Scala Monumentale stairway and Torre del Capitano tower are just a few of the interesting sights that make Morcote an artistic and cultural mecca for tourists.

The highest point on the Rigi-Kulm at 1,797m asl is where visitors can admire a magnificent panorama over Lake Lucerne and the nearby Alps, and to the Swiss Plateau looking north.Back in the 18th century, the Rigi’s unique location made it a famous destination for travellers across Europe. In some ways, it was the pioneer mountain of Alpine tourism. Queen Victoria, no less, was even carried up the peak in a sedan chair. The 19th century saw spas and fashionable hotels opening one after another in Kaltbad, Rigi Kulm and on the Scheidegg, with later additions above the Klösterli monastery and on the Staffelhöhe. The modern era of mass tourism dawned in 1871 with the construction of the Vitznau-Rigi Railway, which went down in history as Europe’s first mountain railway, and the Arth-Rigi Railway in 1875.Several trains dating back to the early days still operate today, with public nostalgia trips scheduled on weekends between July and September. For one journey up the mountain, these lovingly restored steam locomotives dating back more than 100 years use about 500kg of coal and 2,200 litres of water. Together with the modern panoramic cable car from Weggis, the Rigi railways carry 600,000 passengers up the mountain each year. The range of leisure activities and events on offer in both summer and winter is constantly being expanded.In winter, the Rigi is a sunlit isle floating above the sea of mist. At these lofty heights, visitors can choose from a wide range of winter sports: five ski lifts with 15km of ski and snowboard pistes, an airboard piste, 7km of tobogganing runs, a 14km panoramic ski run as well as 35km of groomed winter hiking, snowshoe and Nordic walking trails. Those seeking a more leisurely experience can book a horse sleigh ride.The Rigi is known as a true paradise for hikers, with over 100km of hiking paths and 15km of Nordic walking trails. On the routes between Rigi-Kulm, Staffelhöhe, Kaltbad, Scheidegg and Klösterli, hikers are sure to enjoy spectacular views over the lakes and the Swiss Plateau. The major differences in altitude can easily be conquered by cable car or mountain railway. Young and old alike love to flock to Rigiland in Kaltbad, where they will find a large children’s playground, the Wildmannlipfad trail, a mini-golf course, picnic areas and a natural pond complete with Kneipp path. The Rigi steam railway journey can be combined with a steamer voyage on Lake Lucerne for a truly wonderful experience.In autumn, as the days start to get shorter and the fog cover begins to cloud the mood, it is well worth heading up the Rigi. That liberating feeling when the Rigi Railway rises up through the fog is indescribable. On its sunny terraces, the warm temperatures can be enjoyed alongside glorious views of the blanket of fog below and the surrounding mountains."

Although the Pass is still a long way up, you are already on the biggest Alp in Switzerland and on the soil of the central Swiss canton of Uri amidst 1200 grazing cows. According to legend, the people of Urn took the alp from the Glarus folk by trickery. A mountain path with a splendid view of the Tödi and Clariden mountains links the high plateau of Braunwald with the Urnerboden.Winter hikers have 20km of beautiful and well-prepared hiking trails, not to mention a snowshoeing trail, to explore at their leisure. The Grotzenbüel tobogganing run is sure to provide a whole lot of action and fun – no matter whether you are coasting down it at a leisurely pace with your family, hurtling down it with a pal seated behind you, or on a group excursion.Mountain bikers will find themselves confronted by a whole new range of challenges now that the 47km high mountain trail, otherwise known as the “Braunwald – Grosstal Panorama Tour”, has been open since summer 2017. The route has been created especially with e-mountain bikers in mind.Experienced climbers face the ultimate challenge in the Eggstöcke, while inexperienced climbers can also get an adrenalin rush on the via ferratas.You can also discover some highlights in Braunwald on foot. One not to be missed is the walk to deep-blue Lake Oberblegisee.This unique traffic-free resort in eastern Switzerland, situated at an altitude of 1300 metres has been awarded the official‘Families Welcome’ seal of quality. Particularly popular among the themed trails around Braunwald is the 'Zwerg Bartli’ dwarf trail, which takes you to the original settings described in the fairy story book of the same name. In the fairytale hotel, the Bellevue, the hotelier has been telling fairy stories to spellbound children every day since 1976.In Braunwald, outdoor event management company Adventure Switzerland offers young and old the chance to stay overnight in a tipi, yurt, bubble suite or tree tent at the Braunwald adventure camp. Lots of other exciting and varied outdoor experiences are on offer as well. These range from guided hikes and wild herb courses to a fun group kick-scooter outing.More information"

Brienz,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/brienz/,46.7545,8.03719,"Brienz is located in the middle of charming mountains at the eastern end of turquoise-coloured Lake Brienz. The cosy village is starting point for excursions to the Bernese Oberland, the Ballenberg Open-air Museum but also to Lucerne or Interlaken or across the nearby Alpine passes.","The probably most romantic part of Brienz is the Brunngasse which, having once been awarded the title «most beautiful street in Europe», is well-known abroad. Most of the houses in the street date from the 18th century and are decorated with wood carvings. Brienz, which is well-known as the ""village of carving"" has a long tradition in wood processing and to this day has a school for carving and violin-making.Those in search of winter sports pleasures will strike lucky in nearby Axalp, where there is a small, family-friendly winter sports area – complete with the «Axiland!» learning and experience slopes for children - away from the hustle and bustle. For more experience snow sports enthusiasts there is the Meiringen-Hasliberg ski region which is also easily and quickly accessible.A walk along the traffic-free lake promenade, past small boat ports and playgrounds, is a refreshing experience. In summer locals and visitors come to enjoy a swim. The view of the lake with ever-changing moods is a unique experience. And for an even more intense lake experience, we recommend a cruise, for example on board the historic salon paddle steamer «Lötschberg».The two railway stations are just a short distance away from the ship embarkation point: Brienz is located on the narrow-gauge railway line which links the famous holiday destinations of Interlaken, Meiringen-Hasliberg, Brünig, Lucerne and Engelberg. The other station is the small base station of the steam rack-railway up the Brienzer Rothorn panorama and hiking peak.At the Ballenberg Open-air Museum a look into the kitchens, chambers, living rooms and workshops of the authentically reconstructed houses and farms of agricultural Switzerland dating from the 16th to the 19th century prove that this museum is not about showing off a collection of dusty rareties but instead is dedicated to treating visitors to a real experience."

Today, the fleet numbers five boats, including the splendidly renovated steamer the ""Lötschberg"", built in 1914.

From Brienz, the oldest steam rack railway in Switzerland, the Brienz-Rothorn Railway, takes you up to the Brienzer Rothorn (235 m). From here there is a lovely panoramic view of the lakes and mountain chain. The Brienzer Rothorn is also the starting point for some exciting hikes, not least over the summit to the Brünig Pass.Another destination for a boat trip on Lake Brienz is the Giessbach Falls. The roaring waterfall thunders in a number of different stages down 500 metres into the lake. Immediately beside it is the historic Grand Hotel Giessbach, which looks like a fairytale castle. The oldest funicular railway in Europe leads from the landing-stage in Giessbach straight up to the hotel and the mighty waterfall.

Nowhere else in Switzerland is there so much naturally protected moorland in such a small area as here. The moor landscape is characterised by the great contrast between the smooth, rounded surface contours of the moor and the rugged Schrattenfluh.Sörenberg and the 8 km distant climatic health resort of Flühli form a strong family-oriented vacation destination.

Here you also come across the steam train that takes you to further heights in summer. Below the Rothorn summit lies the Eisee lake - a beautifully deep blue mountain lake and paradise for anglers, nature lovers and hikers alike.The place to combine wellness with purest nature amid a moorland landscape is at the idyllic Schwandalpweiher Kneipp facility by Fühli. An adrenalin kick for the adventurous is guaranteed by the high ropes course - and bikers get their fill on an interesting network of routes.

In Grächen, the children are magically turned into princes and princesses, while the parents can relax in regal style.Grächen is an eldorado for families in winter. They can have fun and games in Switzerland’s largest and most exciting familiy park, the ""SiSu Familienpark"". The three-storey family park, covering an area of more than 50,000m2, offers everything that makes the hearts of families beat faster.

The authentically furnished tepee tents, with a stake and fireplace, reflect the charm of the prairie, and allow children to immerse themselves in the adventures of the Wild West.On the exclusive Ravensburger Spieleweg – a games trail – families can combine an enjoyable walk with exciting games. Playing with the ‘crazy labyrinth’ or the ‘Matterhorn climber’ turns a family hike into an afternoon of games. Each of the 16 huts and games stations becomes a stage on the way to the final destination. There is also guaranteed fun at the adventure playground ‘Robis playground in the forest. In the haunted house, on the giant slide, and on the fairytale-themed walk, all the dreams of adventure come true.Grächen has a reputation as an outstanding area for walking. Passionate hikers appreciate the 250 km network of walking trails which covers the forest, the mountain lake, burbling irrigation channels, and the entrance to the snout of the glacier. The Hannigalp (2,100 m) is the heart of the hiking region: it links the mountain path to Saas-Fee with the Europaweg (Europe Trail) between Zermatt and Grächen – the most famous and beautiful mountain hiking trails in the Alps.The holiday resort has been awarded the ‘Families welcome’ quality mark, providing all the facilities parents could wish for: Children’s equipment for hire and childcare, as well as a kids hotel, playgrounds and a swimming pool are just some of the facilities on offer."

The Roman museum houses a precious Gallo-Roman collection, including a valuable copy of the famous gold bust of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.Every year, the Amphitheater of Avenches is the setting for an Opera Festival and an Openair-Rock Festival as well as the Avenches Tattoo, the only military Tattoo in Western Switzerland. Nearby, a museum can be visited in one of the most beautiful Renaissance palaces in Vaud, built by the Bishop of Lausanne in the 13th century.The region by the little River Broye, with its many nature reserves and terraced vineyards, offers many opportunities for walking, cycling and water sports. On the way, it is worth sampling some wine from one of the region's growers of the sparkling white wine from Mont Vully.Opened in 2000, Musée romain de Vallon was built on an expansive Gallo-Roman estate and boasts two extraordinarily well-preserved mosaics. The museum is not far from Avenches and a must for history buffs.To the museum"

Morges,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/morges/,46.50929,6.49796,"Morges, the small town on Lake Geneva near Lausanne, in addition to interesting museums and sights mainly offers a lot of excursion destinations in the immediate vicinity. The La Côte vineyards deserve particular notice.","The «La Côte» region extends from Morges to Nyon. the hilly landscape between the Jura and lake is one of the biggest wine-growing areas in Switzerland. Particularly between Aubonne and Rolle there are great many typical wine-grower villages, such as Féchy.Morges once upon a time was an important commercial centre. For this reason a port, which nowadays serves as a port for yachts, was built at the end of the 17th century. The promenade along the lake shore of Morges stretches from the castle all the way to the Vertou Park and offers a fantastic view of the lake and Savoy Alps.Morges Castle which was built in 1286 by Ludwig of Savoy houses several military-historic museums, including the museum of historic pewter figures with 10'000 figures. The Alexis Forel Museum located in a historic building in the town which houses a dolls and toy collection as well as an ensemble of furniture from the 16th to the 19th century is also well worth visiting. The Paderewski Museum is dedicated to the musical heritage of the Polish statesman and pianist.The Bière-Apples-Morges railway line carries its passengers out of the town to the countryside which can be explored on foot or by bike. Several hiking trails which lead across fields, vineyards and forests thread through the region. A popular leisure park with a variety of attractions is located on the «Signal de Bougy» hill above the vineyards of Mont-sur-Rolle and Féchy.For lovers of gardens, architecture and art, the Château de Vuillerens with its collection of more than 400 varieties of iris offers a unique spectacle. Not to be missed is the Michalski Foundation, a contemporary and unusual space entirely dedicated to literature, or the library with nearly 65,000 books to make you dream.The small towns and villages of Rolle, Aubonne, Vufflens-le-Château, St. Prex, St. Sulpice and their Romanesque churches are worth visiting. Most of the places have museums or other sights. Regular ship services, including paddle steamers, regularly pick up from embarkation points along the Swiss and French shore. Or you can explore the Lake Geneva landscape on special trips on a new galley which is a copy of the 17th-century original."
Nyon,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/nyon/,46.38085,6.23838,"The spick-and-span little town of Nyon is situated on Lake Geneva, half way between Geneva and Lausanne, amid the vineyards of La Côte. Many excavations and sights from the times of the Celtic Helvetians and the Romans, and from the Middle Ages, bear witness to its eventful history. In summer this is a paradise for lovers of the countryside and water sports.","From the 13th century, the Counts of Savoy began building a mighty castle on top of Roman ruins, dominated by five huge towers. Nowadays this castle, towering over the Old Town, houses the Museum of History and Porcelain, containing valuable items from the former porcelain manufacturing industry in Nyon. From the 16th century onwards, the town was ruled by Berne, and a reminder of this can be seen in the arcades around the market square.Three Corinthian columns on a little hill in the parkland by the lake recall the Roman era. After Julius Caesar had conquered Gaul, he decided to establish the colony of Iulia Equestris with Noviodunum as its urban centre on the site of the present town of Nyon, as shown by the artefacts from excavations on display in the Roman Museum.The Museum of Lake Geneva in the district by the lakeside tells you all about Western Europe's largest lake. There are aquariums, large and small models of boats and a restored steamer to tell the story of the natural history and shipping of the lake. Higher than this district, a promenade offers fine views of the lake, Geneva's nearest mountain - the Mont-Salève - and Mont Blanc.Nyon is surrounded by vineyards. The Route du Vignoble de la Côte from Versoix near Geneva through Nyon to Morges is all about the wines of La Côte and other regional specialities. Local fish from the lake are served with the wines, complementing them perfectly. A little railway line leads into the hinterland of the region, going as far as the Jura resort of Saint-Cergue and the French border in La Cure.A special place of interest is the Toblerone Trail, which has nothing to do with the famous triangular chocolate, but rather the anti-tank defences, similar in shape, forming the ""Promenthouse Line"" which stretched from the foot of the Jura to Lake Geneva. Signposts along the footpath help give you a good impression of what the fortifications of the Second World War were like and also point out a number of unspoilt natural features.The news listed here is maintained by the regional / local tourist offices, which is why Switzerland Tourism can not guarantee the content.Aug 14, 2019 - Aug 24, 2019 For more than thirty years, the city of Nyon has seen its August months pleasantly disturbed by the far ° festival of the living arts. Through his unique works, he explores the fields of theatre, dance, performance and all new artistic practices. Attentive to the most original contemporary aesthetics, the far° has maintained a Swiss and international programming since its inception.

","The symbol of the «world’s smallest metropolis» is the “Jet d’eau” – a fountain with a 140-metre-high water jet at the periphery ofLake Geneva. Most of the large hotels and many restaurants are situated on the right-hand shore of the lake. Theold town, the heart of Geneva with the shopping and business quarter, holds sway over the left-hand shore. It is dominated by St. Peter’s Cathedral, however the actual centre of the old town is the Place du Bourg-de-Four, which is the oldest square in the city. Quays, lakeside promenades, countless parks, lively side streets in the old town and elegant shops invite guests to stroll. One of the best-maintained streets is the Grand-Rue, where Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born. The«mouettes», a type of water taxi, enable crossings to be made from one lakeshore to the other, while larger vessels invite visitors to enjoy cruises on Lake Geneva.Geneva is Switzerland’s most international city, as it is where the European seat ofthe UNOis based. Even the International Red Cross directs its humanitarian campaigns from here. Besides being a congress city, Geneva is also a centre for culture and history, for trade fairs and exhibitions. The «Horloge Fleuri», the large flower clock in the “Jardin Anglais” (English Garden), is a world-renowned symbol of the Geneva watch industry.Culturally, this city on the westernmost fringe of Switzerland has much to offer. International artists perform in theGrand Théâtreand Geneva Opera House, and an extremely diverse range of museums such as the “Musée international de l'horlogerie”, a watch museum with a collection of jewellery watches and musical clocks, and theInternational Museum of the Red Crossand Red Crescent, which provides an insight into the work of these humanitarian organisations, invite city guests to visit them.A rewarding excursion destination isMont Salève, which is situated in neighboring France.

Its lakeside location with breathtaking views of the Alpine panorama, its extraordinarily mild climate, the vineyards, numerous excursion destinations in the region and proud paddlewheel steamers on the lake characterise this town by Lake Geneva.","Vevey experienced its first heyday in the belle époch period at the end of the 19th century. Even today, majestic hotels and a flower-bedecked lakeside promenade lined with palm trees continue to serve as reminders of this age. But Vevey is also a modern, regional centre which is headquarters to Nestlé, the international Food and Beverage Group. Its most famous inhabitant was probably the comedian Charlie Chaplin, who spent the last twenty five years of his life here. A monument dedicated to him stands on the lakeshore.The ski region of Les Pléiades is ideally suited to families because of its gentle slopes. Three circular cross-country ski trails of 3.7 and 10 km in length lead through hills and forests. The snow-covered meadows of the foothills to the Alps also invite visitors to enjoy snow-shoe walks. The Les Avants-Sonloup funicular railway leads to a 2.3-km-long toboggan run.In addition to water sports, the Lake Geneva Riviera is a walker’s and cyclist’s paradise. The region lends itself to exploration by bicycle on various circular routes. A popular downhill route leads from the Les Pléiades ‘lookout’ mountain (1360 m) above Vevey down into the valley. True to its name, the mountain is home to the «AstroPléiades» astronomical trail and an observatory. Les Pléiades with their stunning views across the Waadtland Riviera, Lake Geneva and Alps are also famous for the wild daffodils which flower here on the spring meadows in practically unlimited numbers. A cog railway («Train des Etoiles») leads up from Vevey.Additional railways operating from Vevey serve to open up its hilly hinterland: a funicular railway runs to Chardonne and to Mont-Pèlerin, a nearby, vista-rich relaxation area. Historic steam locomotives and early electric railcars travel along the museum railway line between Blonay and Chamby. The Chaulin-Chamby depot is home to a small railway museum. And the «vine train» (Train des Vignes) wends its way through the wine-growing region of Lavaux."

Schaffhausen,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/schaffhausen/,47.6971,8.63487,"Over the mediaeval Old Town of Schaffhausen looms the imposing Munot fortress. The houses of the Old Town are richly decorated with oriel windows and lavishly painted facades. The town, located on the High Rhine between the Black Forest and Lake Constance, and surrounded by vineyards, is a popular destination for holidays and day-trips.","The town of Schaffhausen is in the northernmost corner of Switzerland, in the “knee” of the Rhine inEastern Switzerlandon the border with Germany. It owes its origins to theRheinfallwaterfall: the settlement arose where shippers needed somewhere to unload and stack their goods when avoiding the rapids that were impassable for ships.The traffic-freeOld Townof Schaffhausen is considered one of the prettiest in Switzerland, on account of its many oriel windows and lavishly painted facades. Many of the fine guildhouses and merchant’s houses date from Gothic and Baroque times. The lively Old Town is very good for shopping. The town began with the street market in what is now the Vordergasse. This is also where you will find the High Gothic St. Johann church with its remarkable acoustics.The emblem of the town, theMunot fortress, can be seen for miles. The ring-shaped stronghold was built between 1564 and 1589 to a design by Albrecht Dürer. You can see far and wide from the battlements. Every evening at 9 p.m., the Munot guard who lives in the tower rings the Munot bell, which used to be a sign that the town gates and inns should close.In the area to the north of Schaffhausen, in the hilly region of the Randen, and on the vine-clad slopes of the Klettgau, there are lovely walks and cycle rides and you can enjoy a tasty drop of Pinot Noir. Learn about how the wine is made during a one-hour walk along theTrasadingen Wine Trailor in theMuseum of Viticulturein Hallau.The riverside landscape along the Rhine is a lovely area for cycling, walking and boating. The popularUntersee Lake-Rhine boat tripfrom Schaffhausen to Kreuzlingen is nearly 50 km long. The section of river between Schaffhausen and the well-preserved little mediaeval town ofStein am Rhein, with its frescos and painted houses, is particularly charming. The Benedictine monastery of St. Georgen now houses the monastery museum. Over the town towers thecastle of Hohenklingen."

Bad Ragaz,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/bad-ragaz/,47.00356,9.5016,"Bad Ragaz in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley at the foot of the Pizol has a long tradition as a health spa. Today it is a wellness resort with top-class hotels, thermal baths and golf courses. The warm (37°C) healing waters bubble up from inside the mountain in the deep, mysterious Tamina Gorge in nearby Pfäfers.","From the middle of the 13th century pilgrims journeyed to the Abbey of Pfäfers near Bad Ragaz, where the Tamina Valley opens into the Rhine Valley, to bathe in the thermal waters. In 1535 the doctor and philosopher, Paracelsus, became the first doctor in Bad Pfäfers and testified to the healing powers of the thermal springs. Thus began the age of spa tourism. In 1716 the earliest baroque bathhouse in Switzerland was built below the Benedictine Monastery in Pfäfers.From 1840 the thermal water was piped down to the more easily accessible village of Ragaz, 4 kilometres away, so Ragaz quickly became a renowned health resort. Luxury hotels were built to accommodate wealthy travellers, including Russian nobility, and, like the richly traditional Grand Hotel in Bad Ragaz, they still attract guests from all over the world. Today Bad Ragaz with its Tamina Thermal Spa, offers a broad range of medicinal and wellness packages.The Pizol ski region stretches between 1600m and 2220m. Winter sports enthusiasts will find 12 railways and lifts, more than 40 km of piste, a free-ride paradise, a winter sports school, cross-country trails and interesting ski tour routes. Toboggan fans will rave about the 7 km toboggan run, and there are marked trails for snowshoe hikers. The attractive mountain footpath affords panoramic views.The two golf courses in Bad Ragaz ideally complement the spa. The Bad Ragaz home mountain, the Pizol, and the plain of the Rhine Valley provide wonderful biking and hiking country. There is a popular cycling and inline skating route on the nearby Rhine Dam. The 5-lake walk on mount Pizol, which takes about four hours to complete, passes five crystal clear mountain lakes and, with its magnificent views of the eastern Swiss alpine landscape, it is a classic among mountain hikes.From Bad Ragaz there are rewarding excursions into Heidi country, to which Bad Ragaz belongs; to the nearby Principality of Liechtenstein; to Chur; the castle at Sargans; St. Gallen and Lake Constance."

Glarus,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/glarus/,47.04092,9.06832,"Glarus, the smallest canton capital in Switzerland, nestles between mountains at the foot of the Glärnisch ridge. The mountain canton of the same name looks back over a long industrial history. Walkers, mountain climbers, cyclists and amateur geologists will discover a varied holiday region with plenty of interesting excursions.","On its way from Lake Zurich through the Linth Plain, the deeply carved Glarus valley branches southwards shortly before the Walensee. Mountains rear up steeply from the valley floor to an altitude of 1750 metres. The Tödi at 3614 m is the highest mountain in eastern Switzerland. The Glarus is a varied holiday region, but it also has a long industrial tradition, particularly in the field of decorative textile manufacture.Since a huge fire destroyed the old quarters in 1861, the streets of the capital of Glarus have been rebuilt on a grid plan. The Glarus earned a world-wide reputation in the 19th century for its printed fabrics. Cyclists can discover evidence of Glarus’ industrial past along the 50km-long Industrial Trail.There are family winter sports’ regions on the Kerenzerberg above the Walensee, in Elm and Braunwald with opportunities for skiing, tobogganing and snowshoe walking as well as many other winter sports. If you like peace and quiet you will enjoy the many winter footpaths in the Glarus.Not far from the capital is the hiking region of the Klöntal with the Klöntalersee. This valley, surrounded by mountains, has a wealth of natural beauties. The Muotathal in the Canton of Schwyz can be reached via the Pragel Pass, along which General Suworow’s army fled to Glarus in 1799. The rumour spread that the Russians had lost their war chest in the waters of the Klöntalersee but, despite many dives to search for it, it has never (yet) been found.There are many sights in the Glarus which bear witness to its extraordinarily rich geological and mining history including, for example, the quarry at Engi; the slate factory in Elm; fossilised sea creatures on the Kerenzerberg; and dinosaur tracks on the Tödi. Along with the regions of the Sarganserland and Walensee, Glarus therefore forms part of the cross-canton GeoPark."

Visitors can enjoy magnificent views of the city and the Bernese Alps from the donjon, which was built at the end of the 12th century.The Burgdorf old town, comprising an upper town and lower town, is regarded as a jewel of urban architecture. The mediaeval urban architecture has to be admired as being virtually perfect: the upper town between the castle and church mound as a feudal residential town with patrician houses in the Bernese late-baroque style and neo-classical buildings, and the granary quarter at the foot of the castle cliff, the lower town linked to the upper town by stairs, which housed the businesses and trades.Today, the alleyways of the old town, with their pleasant street cafés and snug small squares are a popular meeting place for shopping, entertainment and culinary enjoyment in a historic setting.Burgdorf gives sportspersons the opportunity to discover the Emmental and the Mittelland on bicycle.

The village square is still surrounded by original Vals houses roofed with stone tiles made of Vals quartzite. The peaceful Grisons holiday resort offers hiking pleasure, wellness at the thermal spa and winter sports opportunities on the Dachberg.","The Vals Valley owes its wilderness and diversity in a tiny area to the forces of water. In millions of years ice and rain shaped the deeply-cut mountain valley. Vals' most important trump card is the 30-degree thermal source, the only one in the Grisons which springs straight from the ground. The thermal spa designed by star architect Peter Zumthor and built out of local quartzite showcases the elements of water and stone and blends them to create the perfect wellness experience. The building oozing timeless quality and subtle elegance has become a bit of a place of pilgrimage for people interested in architecture.Intact agriculture characterises the valley and delights alert mountain walkers: a few years ago the Vals farmers decided to produce exclusively organic.The peaceful ski region with five lift facilities at the Dachberg is located at altitudes between 1270 and 2941 metres above sea level and is regarded as snow-sure. The sheltered climate in the Central Alps and high-Alpine scenery add to the attractiveness of the Dachberg. Skiers, carvers and snowboarders can enjoy themselves on pistes catering for all abilities. Cross-country skiing, tobogganing, winter walking and snow-shoe trekking are possible too.The wild, rocky Vals Valley and its side valleys are an absolute hiker's paradise. The Vals Mountain-Hiking Bus (Berg-Wanderbus) takes visitors to the starting points of their tours. And steep trails over high passes lead to the neighbouring valleys: Val Lumnezia, Safien Valley, Val di Blenio and the Rhine Forest. Vals is not least a central stop on the ""Big Walser Trail"" which runs from Zermatt through the Alps all the way to the Kleinwalser Valley in Vorarlberg region.The Adula Massif with its 50 peaks is a particular treat for mountaineers visiting the Vals Valley. Searching for crystals is another popular pastime in the Vals Valley as it is well known as a place where magnificent and rare minerals can be found."

Blessed with the warm Valais sunshine, the region is ideal for growing strawberries, apricots, grapes, asparaguses etc. And in the past famous figures, such as Rousseau, Goethe, Stendhal and Liszt, already succumbed to the delights of the region's culinary delights.Martigny's history stretches back two thousand years: Celtic tribes, the Romans and Napoleon's troupes have left behind traces. A restored amphitheatre, Roman thermal baths, temples and living quarters can be admired in Martigny today. Later Martigny became the first bishop's seat in Switzerland and nowadays is admired for the historical districts of La Bâtiaz and Vieux-Bourg featuring several churches and secular buildings worth seeing.The Pierre Gianadda Foundation (Fondation Pierre Gianadda) is the most important cultural attraction in Martigny and in addition to the Gallo-Roman Museum houses a car museum and every year two top exhibitions focussing on world-famous artists. The building was constructed around the remains of a former Roman temple.The French holiday resort of Chamonix is accessible from Martigny in one-and-a-half hours travelling on the boldly constructed narrow-gauge tracks of the ""Mont Blanc Express"". The ""Sankt Bernhard Express"" takes passengers from Martigny to Orsières and from there by bus through impressive mountain countryside to the hospice on the Great St. Bernard.

Vitznau,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/vitznau/,47.0088,8.48406,"Vitznau lies in an idyllic bay of Lake Lucerne at the foot of the Rigi. This holiday resort in central Switzerland is a popular starting point for numerous excursions around the lake, primarily and naturally, up the famous regional mountain.","Only just a half-hour’s journey onboard the Vitznau-Rigi railway separates the village on the lakeshore at 435 metres from the Kulm of the Rigi viewing and climbing mountain at 1798 metres. It is difficult to imagine how arduous the pathway up the «Queen of mountains» must have once been; more affluent guests could afford to have themselves carried up in a sedan chair. When the world’s first rack and pinion railway was opened in 1871, Vitznau became an important interim destination for travellers, who, on arrival by steamship from Lucerne, transferred to the rack railway.A breathtaking panoramic view across the Alps, of 13 lakes and over the entire Swiss Mittelland through to Germany and France can be enjoyed from the summit of the Rigi. A network of walking trails of over a hundred kilometres extends down along the flanks of the mountain. The Rigi is also well known for its rich Alpine flora of around 1000 species. A cableway leads from Vitznau to Hinterbergen, where guests can enjoy the views from the sun terrace of the restaurant. A further small cableway transports visitors from Vitznau to the Wissifluh mountain restaurant, a starting point for many walks and treks.The Vitznau Artillery Fortress was operated as part of the famous Gotthard Fortress in the Rigi rock during the 2nd World War. Its existence was kept highly secret for decades. Since its decommissioning in 1998, visitors have had the opportunity to discover caverns, munitions halls, galleries, casemates and armaments in the accompaniment of a knowledgeable guide – and even spend a night in Switzerland’s first fortress hotel.Family-friendly ski and snowboarding pistes as well as toboggan runs, winter walking trails and cross-country ski trails await sun-seeking winter guests on the Rigi, which mostly lies above the sea of mist. Snow-assured pistes of up to around 2000 metres can be found on the Klewenalp, on the opposing side of the lake. Further ski areas in the region are the Sattel-Hochstuckli and Stoos.In summer, venturing into the surrounding regions onboard one of the historic paddlewheel steamers or saloon motor vessels on Lake Lucerne, which provide a year-round connection between Vitznau and the excursion destinations of Lucerne, Pilatus, Stanserhorn, Bürgenstock, Klewenalp and Seelisberg, is particularly worthwhile.

It is somewhat reminiscent of a fjord landscape, yet remains characterised by a mild lake climate. Boat cruises on board five historic paddle wheel steamers and 15 elegant salon motor vessels count among the highlights of this region.","A steamer cruise across the convolute lake of Lucerne on a sun-filled summer’s day is without doubt a wonderful experience. But a trip on a late scheduled sailing through a mild summer’s evening or, shortly before Christmas, toward the sea of lights that is the town of Lucerne must at least be just as unforgettable. As is the mystical mood on the lake during the autumn mist period, and when the steamer cuts steadily through the waves on Lake Uri whipped up by the föhn wind. Trips in the cosy warmth of the saloon motor vessels, whilst the snow-covered winter landscape passes by outside, can only be described as complete relaxation.The largest shipping company in Switzerland operates the necessary routes to reach many of the most important excursion destinations and mountain cableways of the region, such as the Rigi, Pilatus, Bürgenstock and Klewenalp. Special musical and culinary events are also offered on numerous scheduled and additional trips. The rich offering of delicious foods from the onboard galley provides added enjoyment and pleasure to any cruise.A boat trip can be ideally combined with a walk, such as the ""Weg der Schweiz"" or Swiss Path, a themed trail on the history of Switzerland. Several cycling and skating paths as well as numerous bathing and rest areas are provided along the lake shores. An excursion to the popular sightseeing and shopping town of Lucerne, to include a trip to the Swiss Museum of Transport with its IMAX cinema, the Glacier Garden or a leisurely shopping expedition through the old town, is well worthwhile.The German lake name, ‘Vierwaldstättersee’, has its origins in the four historic ‘Waldstätten’ (lit. forest sites), the three original cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, and the canton of Lucerne, which, together, surround Lake Lucerne. The foundation for the Swiss Confederation was laid in 1291 with the oath taken on the Rütli, a meadow above Lake Lucerne. In the past, the lake was an important transit route, until 1863 in fact the only trade route to the Gotthard pass.The lake route is still plied today by the ""Gotthard Panorama Express"": the trip begins in Lucerne with a cruise to Flüelen, and then continues in first-class panorama carriages across the famous Gotthard railway line through to Ticino."

In winter, the region is a much-loved cross-country skiing paradise.","From Yverdon-les-Bains on Lake Neuchâtel, a road and narrow-gauge railway lead to Sainte-Croix which lies around 20 kilometres away; it lies a similar distance from the French border town of Pontarlier.In 1796 the Geneva-based watchmaker Antoine Favre invented the music box. From 1811 until the end of the 19th century, Sainte-Croix developed to become the world centre for music box manufacturers and nickelodeons. The manufacture of these works of art was carried out to perfection here. Today, two museums present these melodious handicraft items: the CIMA Music Box and Nickelodeon Museum in Sainte-Croix, and the Baud Museum in nearby L’Auberson exhibit unique collections.In winter, visitors are primarily attracted by the excellent cross-county skiing opportunities afforded by the Jura landscape. The marked and well-tended network of ski trails around Sainte-Croix measures more than 100 kilometres and is linked to the adjoining cross-country trail networks in the Neuenburg canton and France.A small snow sports region above Les Rasses on the slopes of the Chasseron awaits skiers. 9 smaller lift facilities provide access to easy and medium difficulty downhill pistes which are especially suited to families. This region also has the largest night skiing area in western Switzerland.The small centre of Sainte-Croix and the resort of Les Rasses form a wide network of beautiful walking trails across Jura meadows and through fir woods. Four marked routes extending to a length of 84 kilometres are provided for mountain bikers. Sainte-Croix is also situated on the Jura Route of the ‘Cycling in Switzerland’ national route network. Walkers and cyclists appreciate the numerous ‘Alpine huts’, which have been enlarged into small hostelries offering local products and specialities."

The unspoiled nature of the nearby Jura heights however also makes the area an attractive leisure region.","Olten lies at the junction of the north-south Basel-Chiasso and east-west Geneva-St.Gallen railway lines. Moreover, a national Autobahn junction is also in the immediate vicinity. The central location of Olten in Solothurn canton is legendary, and the Olten railway buffet is a popular meeting point since it is equally close for all Swiss. Its good accessibility already made the town a popular location early on for trade and industry.The town has numerous hotels and restaurants with a sought-after infrastructure for meetings. Benefiting from having been well maintained is the historic core of the old town. Especially popular are the car-free pedestrian zones with very interesting buildings and attractive shopping possibilities, along with an active music and extraordinarily varied cabaret scene.When undertaking a tour through the old town, a visit to Olten’s museums, the nature museum, art museum, historical museum and home of the cantonal archaeological museum and «Wertpapierwelt», the historical museum of shares and bonds, is well worthwhile. Those with a yearning for the exotic will find Switzerland’s largest Thai temple in nearby Gretzenbach. Finally, on travelling around Olten, visitors will encounter a multitude of interesting fortresses, ruins, castles, churches and chapels.Numerous excursions, walking trails and bicycle tours in a surprisingly untouched natural environment with light broadleaf forests lead towards the Jura and along the course of the river Aare. Following a climb through the famous «Tüfelsschlucht» (Devil's Gorge) on to the «Allerheiligenberg» (All Hallows Mountain) and then making your way on to Belchen, you’re then rewarded with a delightful panoramic view across the Swiss Mittelland. The numerous steep Jura faces, climbing walls and quarries attract ambitious climbers to the region as well.Golf enthusiasts will find a beautiful, 18-hole golf course between Olten and Aarau. The solar bobsleigh run in Langenbruck by Oberen Hauenstein is aimed at children and the young at heart. When snow falls suffice, small ski areas are operated at several other Jura slopes in the winter.

Leventina,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/leventina/,46.48231,8.75661,"The Leventina is mostly known as a transit axis leading from the Gotthard Mountain to the south. At certain points in the partially narrow valley, where trains, roads and super highway emerge, one does not expect to find scenic beauty and cultural and historic sights - but this assumption is unfair.","Leventina stretches from the southern portal of the Gotthard Tunnel near Airolo alongside the Ticino River and extends southward toward the valley up to the town of Biasca. From Airolo, where a cold wind occasionally blows from the Gotthard and where pine forests predominate, it’s only 40 kilometers, but the gradient is an impressive 800 meters. Two valley levels divide the Leventina into three sections. The expressway and the railway line run via imposing architectural masterpieces in order to overcome the differences in height in the narrow valley.The best-preserved village in the Leventina is Giornico, which has old stone buildings, paved roads and two impressive arched bridges across the Ticino. Here, in the Casa Stanga, you will find the Leventina Museum and one of Ticino’s most significant religious buildings, the beautiful Romanesque San Nicola Church - one of several Romanesque masterpieces in the Leventina - with beautifully preserved frescoes.Skiers find in Airolo a snow-guaranteed, popular skiing area with a modern cabin lift and 30 kilometers of runs. A smaller skiing area awaits you above Faido at Cari.The region is a marvelous hiking area with intact villages, Romanesque art treasures, idyllic mountain lakes, mountain farming, and a diverse flora and agricultural products, including chestnuts, Alpine roses, blueberries, mushrooms and Alpine cheeses. The best-known hiking route in the Leventina is the “Strada Alta”, the panoramic mountain trail from Airolo to Biasca.High above the Leventina, the high altitude trail “Sentiero Alto del Tremorgio” runs from the Pesciüm Mountain Station (1745m) near Airolo, through a sparse mountain forest and romantic landscapes to the mountain lake of Tremorgio. Hike down to Prato, or ride the cable car across the valley to Rodi.Even down in the valley unforgettable adventures await. For example, hiking the historic mule-traders path through the narrow Piottino Gorge, which, besides the Schöllenen Gorge and Via Mala, is one of Switzerland’s most impressive transit routes."

In the middle of this picture postcard scenery, nestling between the slopes of the Moléson and the Dent du Chamois, rises the medieval, traffic-free little town of Gruyères, with its castle, surrounded by a fortified wall.Inside the 13th century castle is a museum covering eight centuries of the architecture, history and culture of the region. In the second, smaller castle in Gruyères, St. Germain, is the HR Giger museum. It was Giger who designed the horrific fantasy figures for the Hollywood film ""Alien"". The museum houses the artist's most important pictures and sculptures from 1960 to the present day, and there is also an HR Giger bar.An important part in the picturesque overall scene in the little town is played by the several restaurants serving specialities from the Gruyère region: fondue, raclette and, especially, desserts made with the excellent Gruyère double cream.In the modern show cheesery at Gruyères you can see how the tasty Gruyère cheese is made. And to round off the tour of culinary delights: for those with a sweet tooth it would be worth taking a guided tour round the Maison Cailler The Swiss Chocolate factory in nearby Broc.The Moléson skiing area (2003 m) is the largest skiing area in the Fribourg region. The eight lifts and 35 km of pistes offer slopes to suit all the family. The gondola lift in Charmey takes skiers up to the Vounetz (1627 m), and then you can recover afterwards in the water playgrounds. Not far from Gruyères there are also the winter sports areas of La Berra, Charmey and Jaun.The idyllic landscape of the Gruyère region and the increasingly wild valley towards the Jaun Pass present a paradise for hikers and mountain bikers. A themed trail lets visitors discover the world of Alpine cheesemaking, linking the modern cheese dairy in Pringy-Gruyères with the Alpine dairy in Moléson-Village. Meanwhile, the counts' trail connects Gruyères and Montbovon, a route along which cheese was first exported.Accessible according to individual's wishes and abilities. A system of tokens gives you access to all these leisure pursuits: Bobsleigh, Dowhill-scootering, Grass scooter, minigolf, Cheese dairy on the alp.Attention: one must be taller than 1.4 m.

Lake Gruyère,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/lake-gruyere/,46.66192,7.09648,"The harmonious countryside around Lake Gruyère is home to the black and white Fribourg cows, which provide the milk for the aromatic Gruyère cheese and famous double cream. Another culinary delight on offer in the area is chocolate – and a festival of regional specialities draws in the crowds each year.","Lake Gruyère is arguably the most beautiful reservoir in Switzerland. Without a doubt, the artificial lake between the cities of Fribourg and Bulle, which is fed and drained by theRiver Saane(French: Sarine), is the longest in the country, at 13.5km. The dam at Rossens was completed in 1947.At the northern end of the lake lies the smallOgoz Island (Île d’Ogoz), on which a small chapel sits perilously close to the edge of the artificial lake. The many wedding parties that wish to reach the chapel must get there by boat. It is well worth embarking on this journey by pedal boat, rowing boat or sailing boat, even if you’re not getting married!The Gibloux mountain looms over the lake on the western side. Its summit is home to the Gibloux Radio Tower, complete with observation deck. On the opposite side of the lake in the Fribourg Pre-Alps liesLa Berra, renowned above all for being a family-friendlywinter sports resort. In this area, there are four lifts and a telemixte giving visitors access to 20km of slopes. Asnow park, tobogganing run, three marked snowshoe trails and opportunities for ski and snowshoe tours round off the offering to delight winter guests. Tourists will find various theme, myth and fairytale trails for walks around the lake, as well as a golf course and campsite.The village of Broc lies at the southern end of the reservoir. It is home to Switzerland’s firstchocolate factory, which was built by chocolate pioneer Alexandre Cailler in 1898. Tours (incl. visit to the factory shop) offer an insight into the sweet secrets of chocolate making. Broc also has an energy information centre, housed in an operational hydroelectric power plant.Also on the southern edge of the lake, nestled between the slopes of theMolésonand Dent du Chamois, sits the medieval and car-free town ofGruyèresand itscastlesurrounded by fortified walls. Nearby is the big Gruyèresshow dairy, one of the region’s top attractions. Nearby Bulle, the economic centre of the Gruyère region, is famous for its fascinating heritage and folk art museum and the annual festival of regional produce, held in October, which is highly regarded throughout Switzerland."

Brunnen,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/brunnen/,46.99418,8.60535,"Brunnen is situated on the shores of Lake Lucerne with views of the Urnersee to the east, and across to the Bürgenstock and Gotthard Massif. Thanks to its central location amidst a diverse mountain and lakeside scenery, Brunnen is an ideal starting point for excursions in central Switzerland","The holiday resort of Brunnen lies directly on beautiful Lake Lucerne, nestling between the Urmiberg and Stoos-Fronalstock and facing the Rütli and Schillerstein mountains in the heart of William Tell country. The resort is well served by railway, bus, motorway and boat as well as by a little cableway up the Urmiberg, the eastern foothill of the Rigi.The historic Axis Road, built with many artistic buildings into the steep rocks on the eastern shore of Lake Uri, has linked Brunnen with Flüelen since 1865.Brunnen enjoyed early prominence when, in 1865, King Ludwig II, a great admirer of William Tell, travelled to Brunnen. Regularly at midnight, he would have himself rowed out on the Urnersee to listen to alpine horn music, played at his command, against the backdrop of fairytale mountain scenery. Many writers and painters, including Goethe and Spitteler, have also been much taken with Brunnen.The winter sports region of Stoos-Fronalpstock, the ski resorts of Mythen, Sattel-Hochstuckli and Rigi are about 30 minutes away from Brunnen, and there is a choice of 40 transport facilities and 80 km of pistes. Winter hiking, cross-country ski trails, sledging runs and snow-shoe trekking etc. guarantee plenty of variety.The fjord-like tips of the Urnersee promise lots sailing and swimming fun, while the surrounding countryside is an unforgettable cycling experience. There are rewarding excursions to Rigi and the Bürgenstock, the Muotathal with its cave, Treib-Seelisberg, the Stoos-Fronalpstock, the Goldau zoo, and the towns of Schwyz, Zug, Lucerne and Altdorf.Keen walkers should include a few stages of the ‘Swiss Trail’ around the Urnersee: it begins at Rütli, the birthplace of the Federation of Swiss Cantons 1291, and ends in Brunnen. There are scheduled boats at each of the towns along the trail for the return journey. Strong cyclists will enjoy the 40 km tour around Mythen.A wide range of accommodation, wellness and sports facilities await on the sunny terrace of Morschach above Brunnen. Have pure unadulterated fun in the whirlpool, wild-water stream, children’s pool with a 100-metre chute, and a large sports centre. The wellness oasis includes a Roman-Irish thermal bath, brine bath, invigorating herbal baths, massage, fitness and beauty centres."
Rütli – Rütli Meadow,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/ruetli-ruetli-meadow/,0.0,0.0,"Rütli is synonymous, for all Swiss people, with the founding history of Switzerland. Nourished by the impressive drama «William Tell» by Friedrich Schiller, it is for many people the historic place where in 1291 the oath of the Swiss Confederation was sworn (Founding history of Switzerland).","On August 1, 1291, now celebrated as the Swiss National Holiday, the three original cantons, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden united and founded with a loyalty oath the Confederation at the forest site. The Rütli was bought in 1859 by a private organization, which a year later presented it to the Swiss Confederation. And so it became known as the “birthplace of Switzerland”.In remembrance of the historic Rütli Oath, the Rütli Shooting has been staged since 1862, albeit not on the National Holiday, but on the Wednesday before St. Martin’s Day, on November 11th.The easiest way to the Rütli is by boat from Brunnen or Flüelen. There are hiking trails to and from Seelisberg, but these are very steep and strenuous. The “Swiss Path”, a 34km hike around the historic Lake Uri, begins on the Rütli."

The well paved mountain road up by the gorge is a delight in itself, especially when the snowy mountains suddenly appear at the end of the valley.The picturesque Valais village of Grimentz at an altitude of 1,564m belongs to the municipality of Anniviers in the eponymous valley. A tour of the village reveals all of its charms - and the Burgher House from 1550 forms the center of the village. In its cellar, a white glacier whine matures in old larchwood barrels – a speciality of the nomadic farmers of the past. Historically, this wine was only served if the bishop came to visit during the year.The Val d'Anniviers has 100 kilometres of scenic hiking trails and biking routes. In the glacier forefield of the Moiry-glacier one can observe various geomorphological forms, as well as areas of ice and block glaciers that are covered by a lot of moraine debris. The skiing area ranges up to an altitude of 3000 meters in the winter. The offerings are complemented by a Fun Park, guided tours, cross country ski runs, a toboggan run and winter hiking trails.The Grimentz ski slopes above Bendolla stretch along the Becs de Bosson up to an altitude of almost 3000 metres, affording stunning views over the Val d'Anniviers and Rhone Valley.

The alluvial fan of the huge avalanche is now home to the renowned Goldau Zoo. Last but not least, Arth-Goldau is an important railway node along the Gotthard line.","In the railway station, the line from the Gotthard forks into two branches, one heading for Zurich and the other for Lucerne/Basel. Arth-Goldau also lies along the route of the “Voralpenexpress” from Lucerne to Romanshorn. Above all however, the railway node is the valley station for the cog railway leading up the “queen of the mountains”, up the Rigi, on whose north-eastern foot Arth-Goldau lies.The Rosberg, on the opposing valley side, is where, well over 200 years ago, one of Switzerland’s greatest natural disasters started: On 2 September 1806, a massive 40 million cubic metres of rock mass loosened itself after heavy rainfalls and thundered down into the valley. The landslide destroyed Goldau and its surroundings, 457 people lost their lives in the process. The “Landslide Trail” is a themed walking trail about the Goldau landslide. There is also a landslide museum in Goldau. The alluvial fan, representing a wild primordial landscape with huge rocks, at the very centre of Goldau village is now home to Goldau Zoo which has 100 native and European animal species. It is an especially popular excursion destination with families.Arth on Lake Zug is the starting point for a leisurely trip onboard a scheduled Lake Zug passenger boat. What’s more, the lakeside village has a small, but excellent family swimming area with a garden restaurant, children’s splash pools and playgrounds. Another attractive swimming area can be found in Lauerz on the same lake, but east of Arth-Goldau. Arth-Goldau is situated in the heart of a cherry tree region. In spring, blossom time is a particularly aesthetic natural spectacle; a visit to a Kirsch distillery is an experience at any time of year.As far as diversity is concerned, the excursion and hiking mountain of Rigi can hardly be surpassed: from Rigi-Kulm, visitors can enjoy a breathtaking panoramic vista across the Alps, over 13 lakes and across the Swiss Mittelland as far as Germany and France. The mountain offers over 100 km of walking and rambling paths, including an educational forest trail near Arth. The two cog railways from Goldau and Vitznau, plus aerial cableways, provide for different walking and round trip combinations. In winter, the white Rigi ski, tobogganing and winter walking region attracts visitors to enjoy sports and fun in the snow."

And if you’re after rest and relaxation, you can be in the Swiss mountains in less than an hour.","Why ZurichZurich is Switzerland’s centre of economic life and education. Located in the heart of Europe, the city offers all the modern amenities of a cosmopolitan metropolis, without sacrificing its natural side. Zurich has for years ranked among the world’s top cities in terms of quality of life. It is a boutique city that offers everything that implies, albeit in small and exquisite format.Creativity and innovationZurich is avant-garde: it was not only home toDada, but also the place where theFreitag bagand world-renowned Helvetica typeface originated. Researchers at the revered Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and companies such as Google and Disney Research produce one innovation after the next. Creativity is also in abundance thanks to one of the biggest universities in Europe devoted to the arts – Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) – while establishments such as the Kunsthaus Zürich,Haus KonstruktivandMuseum für Gestaltungensure that it all doesn’t fall into oblivion.Cultural diversityZurich was already a prosperous centre of commerce in the Early Middle Ages. The 1519 Reformation gave the economy such a boost that the city rapidly became Switzerland’s financial centre. This has remained unchanged to the present day and is why you’ll find the Swiss National Bank in Zurich along with the world-famousBahnhofstrasse, one of the most luxurious shopping strips around.Sumptuous discoveriesZurich’s inhabitants don’t just eatBircher muesliand “Züri Gschnätzlets” (sliced beef). They are veritable cosmopolitans and love sophisticated delicacies from across the globe. They do their utmost to embrace trends immediately – with creativity and delight. And this earns them awards: Zurich has one of the highest numbers of Michelin-starred restaurants per inhabitant in Europe. The city’s rustic pubs, street food festivals and pop-up restaurants in empty factories are also enjoying a great degree of popularity. All the city’s culinary offerings – and a lot more besides – can be sampled by the way at the annual FOOD ZURICH festival.Zürich Card – Your city travel passWith the Zürich Card, city explorers can enjoy Zurich in all its diversity and save time and money.The Zürich Card offers the following for 24 or 72 hours:Unlimited 2nd class travel by tram, bus, train, boat and cable car in the city of Zurich and surrounding regionShort boat trips and Limmat river cruiseFree or reduced admission to 43 museums50% discount on the Zurich Old Town Walking TourAnd many more experiencesFurther information about the Zürich CardA lot goes on in and around Zurich in winter. Those into sports go tobogganing, skiing, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing in the snow-covered winter wonderland. Others seeking a bit of peace and quiet retire to a hammam or spa, while gourmets indulge in a fondue or hot chocolate.Zurich is abuzz in summer: this is the time when friends, work colleagues and families meet on the promenades of Lake Zurich, in their local neighbourhoods, on pretty garden terraces or in one of more than 40 “Badis” – how the Zurich inhabitants affectionately refer to their lidos by the water.An economic hub, university city and boutique metropole by the water offering a high quality of life: Zurich combines the advantages of a green and modern city at the foot of the Alps with excellent infrastructure and a strong network of business, education and ambitious start-ups. The city is a centre of research, development, business formation and innovation, not to mention a great place to live."

A further landmark of the town is theMuseggmauer, a wall which, with the exception only of one of its towers, has been preserved in its original, well-fortified state.Historic houses decorated with frescoes line the picturesque town squares as they do the ‘Weinmarkt’ square in the car-free old town. Lucerne is a city of town squares and churches. TheJesuit churchdating from the 17th century is regarded as Switzerland’s first sacral Baroque building and the twin towers of the Hofkirche form an integral part of the townscape. The figure of a dyinglionwhich was hewn from the face of rock in remembrance of the heroic death of Swiss guards killed during an attack on the Tuileries in 1792 is one of the best-known monuments in Switzerland. And with its 112-metre-longBourbaki panorama, Lucerne possesses one of the world’s few maintained, mammoth circular paintings.Tradition and modernity stand side-by-side with ease in Lucerne, as the town has also earned a reputation for itself with innovative design. The futuristicCulture and Convention Centre (KKL), designed by leading French architect Jean Nouvel, is one the architectural highlights of the town. The KKL is also a landmark of «Lucerne: Festival City» and venue for a wide variety of cultural events throughout the year.Lucerne is the ideal starting point for many excursions to the highlights of central Switzerland. A trip up one of Lucerne’s regional mountains, thePilatusor theRigi– the queen of mountains – is a must. But excursions up onto theStanserhorn, theBürgenstockor a steamship cruise onLake Lucernewith its many bends and arms are certainly no less worthy. TheGotthard Panorama Expressoriginates in Lucerne and ferries its passengers to the foot of the Gotthard pass via Lake Lucerne and then continues by rail into Ticino, south of the Alpine ridge. The «cherry road» leads from Lucerne through the landscape of cheery trees and kirsch.With first-class infrastructure and a diverse range of hotels, Lucerne in the very heart of Switzerland leaves nothing to be desired. The city boasts multifunctional event centres such as the world-famous KKL Luzern (Lucerne Culture and Convention Center) designed by star architect Jean Nouvel and a large number of hotels with state-of-the-art infrastructure.

Veysonnaz,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/veysonnaz/,46.19599,7.33775,"Veysonnaz is a mountain village typical of the Valais canton, situated on a slope above Sion, with beautiful views over the Rhone valley and to the Bernese Alps. The hiking area extends right up to the high peaks of the Valais Alps. In winter, Veysonnaz forms part of the ""Four Valleys"" skiing area, with over 400 km of prepared slopes.","The little resort of Veysonnaz, located at about 1200 m, is 13 kilometres by road from Sion, the capital of the canton of Valais. Far below is the broad Rhone valley, and opposite, the northern chain of the Valais Alps, with the wide glaciers of the Plaine Morte. To the west, you can see as far as the bend in the valley where Martigny is situated.Veysonnaz combines a modern tourist infrastructure with its original village features and the authentic way of life of the upland and alpine economy. Taking the cows up the mountain in June and the (bloodless) cow fights between the naturally combative Eringer (Hérens) cows of the Valais are traditions that are still alive and well here.As soon as the snow comes, Veysonnaz becomes a winter sports paradise. World Cup races take place on the ""Piste de l'Ours"" above Veysonnaz. The huge ""Four Valleys"" skiing area stretches from Veysonnaz and the adjacent Les Collons / Thyon 2000, taking in Nendaz and Mont Fort (3330 m), and extending as far as Verbier and La Tzoumaz, opening up no fewer than 410 km of slopes and 95 lifts for skiers of all abilities. Naturally, there are winter sports schools for children and adults, as well as lots of alternative winter activities for non-skiers.There are about 300 km of footpath in the area around Veysonnaz, and there are also opportunities for more challenging tours in the high mountains. The walks take you through unspoilt nature: in Veysonnaz, the flora and fauna and grazed pastureland are all protected. The ""Bisse de Vex"", a traditional open irrigation channel (""Suone"") typical of the Valais and dating from the 15th century, has been extensively restored for 12 kilometres of its length and now the water is flowing again. These ""Suonen"" give some idea of the concerns local people had about water, and nowadays provide pleasant walks with no great differences in altitude, but mostly with fantastic views.For families with children aged between 4 and 8, in the peak summer season there is a children's entertainment programme provided every day in the ""Bears' Club"".

Centuries-old villages with their typical dwellings lean against steep slopes.","The gate to Val d'Hérens (Eringer Valley) is formed by the famous earth pyramids of Euseigne, steep stone towers crowned with rock boulders. Past the gate, the cauldron-like, green high-altitude valley comes into view. Framed by a superb peak crown, the mighty Dent Blanche towers over it in all its glittering glory. Val d'Hérens with its charming mountain villages such as Evolène, Les Haudères or Arolla, preserves the old Valaisian traditions.The large dam wall of the Grande Dixence, at 285 meters the world’s highest dam wall, is located in the side valley of Val d'Hérémence.

Their skiing areas are found at nearly 3000 meters. Especially Arolla with its higher pistes is considered to be snow-assured. Cross-country skiers explore the area on 35 kilometers of Nordic tracks. Heliskiing, torch and moonlight skiing, winter hiking, ice climbing, toboggan runs and ice-skating complete the offering. Arolla is also the starting point for extensive ski tours in the region of the Valaisian High Route.Evolène is one of the Valaisian villages defined by great ambiance and authenticity. It has numerous block buildings with several floors. No less than 250 kilometers of hiking paths and more than 100 kilometers of mountainbike trails surround the village in the center of the valley. Arolla, at the back of the valley, is a place of tranquility in the midst of Swiss pine forests and an imposing glacial world. It is the starting point for extensive mountain and climbing tours."

Sledgers will love the run down from the Windegga to Malbun or on the floodlit 1000 m long natural sledging run down from Alp Stücka to Steg. From the Maiensäss Steg below Malbun there are 15 km of cross-country skiing trail leading into the idyllic Valüna valley. Three kilometres of this is illuminated at night.The extensive network of mountain footpaths around Malbun leads you into an idyllic, virtually untouched natural landscape. The geography of this little country makes it an outstanding bikers’ destination, with lots of tricky dedicated trails and paths. An ideal starting point for hiking and mountain biking tours is the top of the chair-lift on the Sareiser Joch. Fun for the little ones is guaranteed at the children’s playground on the sunny panorama terrace of the mountain restaurant (2015 m) or at the Pet Donkey Zoo.Distances are small in the “little country”. Vaduz is only 15 km away from Malbun: reason enough to enjoy the cultural offerings in the “little town” from time to time, even if you are holidaying in Malbun.Halfway to Vaduz is Triesenberg, perched high above the Rhine valley.

Hallau,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/hallau/,47.69704,8.4572,"The impressive winegrowing village of Hallau, with its beautifully maintained appearance, is nestled among the extensive vineyards of Klettgau, which the locals often refer to as “Weinfass und Kornkammer” (“Wine cask and granary""). ","The well-known winegrowing village of Hallau lies north of the Rhine in the canton of Schaffhausen, nestled amid the extensive vineyards, fields and forests of Klettgau, a fertile plain between Hochrhein and Schwarzwald.Stately houses, gurgling fountains and idyllic laneways and squares give this pretty locality its very special charm. One particularly striking feature is the village's main street with its grand town hall, inviting inns and numerous fountains, which almost resembles a street from a small town.Viticulture and wine are omnipresent in and around the village. With 150 hectares, Hallau is home to the largest continuous area of vineyards in German-speaking Switzerland. Behind the village, the vineyard terraces widen into a kind of arena, at the centre of which the famous late Goth mountain church of St Moritz sits resplendent. Built in 1491 and dedicated to Saint Mauritius, the church is a symbol of both Hallau and Klettgau. Located on a promontory of Hallauerberg mountain, the church towers above the village, visible from afar and highly sought-after as a “wedding church”.ISOSISOS is the Federal Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites of national importance.

Le Pont,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/le-pont/,46.66524,6.33118,"Le Pont is located in an idyllic setting at the eastern end of Lac de Joux, with water to the fore and a breathtaking hilly landscape to the rear.","Until the beginning of the 19th century, the village’s inhabitants relied mostly on agriculture and dairy production, although some watchmaking workshops also began to appear. A major change took place at the end of the century, after the construction of a railway line to Vallorbe in 1886 provided better access to the valley. Becoming an important holiday destination for foreign tourists, the village underwent a metamorphosis. Several farms were converted into accommodation, with their buildings refurbished to hide their original rural function, and new properties were built, such as the Grand-Hôtel overlooking the village – a majestic example of the Belle Époque style at the turn of the century.Despite the progressive additions to its built environment during the 20th century, Le Pont has managed to retain its characteristic historical structure. Its small centre forms an arc only a few metres above the surface of the lake, creating an impression of unity that is reinforced by the succession of facades establishing a kind of fortified front. Each house is nevertheless independent, separated from the others by narrow alleys, and maintains a close relationship with the courtyards, gardens and orchards that appear directly behind the front.ISOSISOS is the Federal Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites of national importance.

St-Saphorin (Lavaux),https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/saint-saphorin/,46.47302,6.79621,"The sunny winegrowing village of Saint-Saphorin lies on the shore of Lake Geneva, nestled among the terraced vineyards of Lavaux, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ","The enchanting winegrowing village of Saint-Saphorin lies in the heart of the Lavaux vineyards, just at the foot of the first slope of Mont Pèlerin. Since the village was once threatened by landslides, the authorities decided to build arcades, on which the facades of the houses were then constructed. It is for this reason that Saint-Saphorin is also known as a fortified village.The centre of the village is characterised by narrow passages and cobbled laneways. The lanes are lined with vintners' houses and simple dwellings, most of which have been built in the characteristic style of the region. These typical regional houses are distinguished by their lime-covered masonry structures as well as their symmetrical, colourful facades. The village square, also referred to as Pappelplatz, is surrounded by important buildings such as reformed church with its bell tower and the Auberge de l’Onde. The square also hosts various festivals, including spring, grape harvest and Christmas celebrations. The harbour, which is divided from the lake by the railway line, is at the lower end of the village.Saint-Saphorin was also a place of refuge for many artists, who transformed the village into a little cultural centre. For example, Vaud's most famous chansonnier, Jean Villad Gilles, made the village his home.ISOSISOS is the Federal Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites of national importance.

Lac de Joux,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/lac-de-joux/,46.63814,6.28743,"Lac de Joux in the Vaud Jura is located at 1,000 metres in the valley of the same name (Vallée de Joux). The stark beauty and unspoilt nature of the high valley and the lake attract countless visitors all year round; in summer mainly for water sports, biking and hiking and in winter for ice-skating and cross-country skiing.","Set between Mont Tendre (1,679 m) and the densely wooded chain of the Risoux, along the ridge of which runs the border between Switzerland and France, the Lac de Joux is the largest expanse of water in the Jura region. Well known for its favourable wind conditions, the lake attracts a large number of yachters and windsurfers, but is also ideal for rowing boats, water skiing and wakeboarding. Water temperatures between 18 and 24 degrees also tempt a lot of swimmers here. There is an extensive network of routes for cycling and mountain biking in the hilly natural paradise around the lake, and a number of fine footpaths.Lac de Joux and the nearly adjacent but much smaller Lac Brenet have no surface drainage; the water trickles away underground and only comes to the surface again a few kilometres away near Vallorbe. In July and August there is just one scheduled boat service every day on the Lac de Joux, doing a round trip in the afternoons, starting at Le Pont at the north-eastern end of the lake. In June and September, the boat only runs on Saturdays and Sundays. This makes the Lac de Joux shipping company one of the smallest in Switzerland, and a ride on the lake something really special.In winter, the frozen lake becomes a huge ice rink, and a paradise for skaters and ice-walkers. Otherwise, the rest of the Vallée de Joux in winter is mainly an endless cross-country skiing paradise, with about 200 kilometres of prepared tracks in virtually untouched nature. The Jura landscape, with its gentle hills and large wooded areas, also offers excellent opportunities for fantastic snow shoe excursions – even lasting several days – or exciting rides on dog sleds.The news listed here is maintained by the regional / local tourist offices, which is why Switzerland Tourism can not guarantee the content.Teste1"

The rocky mountainsides enclosing it rise for undreds of metres and are the most obvious feature left by the glaciers which covered the region in a distant age. The Basodino glacier is the furthest point in this broad and sometimes wild valley. Working for hundreds of years, humans have managed to create meadows, fields and space to grow vegetables between huge boulders and precipices. Nowadays, this wild valley still offers visitors the chance to discover plenty of natural and cultural attractions. For instance, there is the Foroglio waterfall in the hamlet of the same name, which plunges with a mighty roar into the valley from 80-meter high rocks. The educational trail featuring the ascent to and descent from the Alpine pastures in the Bavona Valley is also of interest.Another special feature of the Bavona Valley is the absence of an electricity network: energy requirements are met from solar power alone, although the power plants in the valley itself produce large amounts of electricity.Hiking, cycling and mountain biking"

Arolla,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/arolla/,46.02442,7.48235,The small village of Arolla in the Val d'Hérens (Eringer Valley) lies at the foot of majestic mountain peaks and is the starting point for various hiking and ski tours.,"Tourists wanting to visit the remote place in the19th century had no other option than setting foot on the strenuous mule path. Meanwhile, the village is accessible from all directions, yet at the same time has fortunately lost none of its original charm.The ski resort offers five ski lifts, 47 km of slopes and guaranteed snow until spring thanks to its high elevation. Arolla is also popular for its ski tours and represents a leg of the ""Haute Route"", which runs from Zermatt to Chamonix. A beautiful cross-country ski trail leads to the Arolla glacier and the Borgne river and, all in all, you have 10 kilometers of well-prepared cross-country trails at your disposal in this attractive region.Snowshoe walkers also get their fill of enjoyment with over 85 kilometers of safe, marked trails leading through the Val d'Hérens (Eringer Valley) as they discover the natural, almost magic landscapes of this particular valley. Here, tours lead through forests and clearings, past authentic villages with sun-tanned chalets and a number of restaurants - where you’re spoilt for choice with tasty regional dishes.Arolla is your starting point for around 50 hikes, including the Col de Riedmatten, from where you enjoy stunning views and can even be surprised by the appearance of an ibex, marmot or chamois. The breathtaking mountain and glacier landscape and natural farming here is simply remarkable. I00 kilometers of marked routes are open to mountain bikers and fishers can try to get a bite in the mountain lakes. Paragliding is another enjoyable outdoor pastime as well!"

Porrentruy,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/porrentruy/,47.41665,7.07559,"The city of Porrentruy (Pruntrut in German) in the Jura is considered to be the cultural center of the region. The cityscape is dominated by the mighty medieval castle, which served as the residence of the prince bishops of Basel for 200 years.","Located near the French border, Porrentruy is the second largest city in Canton Jura. The Old Town, which has burgher houses in the Aaroque, Gothic and Neoclassical style, is well worth a visit. Large fountains such as the Samaritan Fountain (1564) and the Swiss Fountain (1518) are interspersed between the houses. The ""Porte de France"", built in 1563, is a remnant of the medieval city fortifications.The churches of Saint Pierre (14th century) and Saint Germain (13th century) house rare side altars and church treasures. The oldest part of the castle dates back to 1271. The castle towers above the city and was the residence of the prince bishops of Basel from 1527-1792.Stained-glass windows in the Jura: an artistic phenomenon unique in Europe. With their almost sixty churches and chapels, the inhabitants in the Jura canton have, in less than half a century, created a museum of art – modern, alive and open. This is the largest concentration of stained glass across a relatively small region in Europe. Great masters – Frenchmen, Swiss and Jura canton inhabitants – created these works.Fertile agricultural land and many vineyards dominate the wide landscape of the Ajoie (in German: Elsgau) to the north of the hilly Jura folds. It is an ideal area for hiking and biking tours and tours lasting several days with a horse-drawn gypsy caravan are also popular. The Ajoie is known as the «fruit orchard of the Jura» on account of its many vineyards and famous but rare Damson or Damascene plum trees.Particularly worth visiting in the Ajoie are the caves of Réclère (Grottes de Réclère) and the family-friendly prehistoric park at Réclère, which focuses on the evolution of fauna from fishes via dinosaurs to mammals."

The Upper Lauterbrunnen Valley,https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/destinations/the-upper-lauterbrunnen-valley/,46.5954,7.90791,"The Upper Lauterbrunnen Valley is the way it always was with its gorgeous high mountain scenery and many waterfalls. And yet, it is still relatively undiscovered, not overrun by tourists - a genuine paradise.","Since 1960 the entire Upper Lauterbrunnen Valley has been under the protection of the Canton. It all began when Pro Natura acquired Alp Untersteinberg from the proceeds of a heritage protection project in 1947. The protected area was expanded in 1954 by the purchase of Alp Breitlauenen. The valley is approximately 25 km in size and the gorgeous high mountain scenery is many-faceted and has a rich plant life.Many mountain brooks, originating at the edge of the glacier, make their way down into the valley, tumbling over several terraces with a great roar. The Lauterbrunnen Valley has 72 waterfalls, with Holdribach Fall and Talbach Fall among the most attractive. The high mountain valley offers a rich variety of vegetation with a beautiful high moor and many colourful meadows. Ibex and chamois are also frequently seen on the mountain slopes. The Upper Lauterbrunnen Valley is the starting point for a wide range of walks and with the opportunity to spend the night at the Obersteinberg mountain inn, you feel like you took a trip back in time. The hotel has no electricity or showers. The only light is provided by candles and the meals are cooked on a wood-fired stove. Mules are carrying the food up to 1800 meters and an alpine dairy makes specialties available just like it did 200 years ago.All is well with the world here in the Upper Lauterbrunnen Valley, with barely a soul in sight. It is ideal for hikers who seek peace and a fascinating landscape without sharing it with lots of others.More information:Kerzenhotel ObersteinbergBerggasthaus TrachsellauenenTrümmelbach Falls – in the Valley of the 72 WaterfallsStaubbach Falls - free falling waters with a mist of sprayTheme Trails in UNESCO World Heritage Region"
